 p class="noImagePar" The Botswana Hippo are semi-aquatic and are found by rivers, floodplains and swamps. During your Botswana safari you will see them along the the a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za place Chobe-National-Park.html"  Chobe River  a  and in the floodplains of the  a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za place Okavango-Delta.html" Okavango Delta  a .  p 
 p class="noImagePar" The deep grunting of hippo is one of Africa's characteristic sounds and most people who have been on an African safari will have heard the sound. Although they are grazers hippos are blessed with massive teeth that are used in territorial fights and displays. These teeth are also used to defend territories from humans.  br

Besides isolated cases of hippo where they are hunted by  a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za lion-guide.html" lions  a  their main threat is from humans. That said there is a pride of a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za Botswana_Wildlife_Behaviour-travel lions-of-northern-botswana.html"  lions in northern Botswana  a  that used to prey on hippo regularly. The majority of hippo   predator interaction is from hippo defending their territories from roaming predators. br

Hippos' reaction to predators shows an inherent dislike and on a number of occasions I have witnessed  strong hippos chasing predators of a kill  strong . On the Chobe floodplains one morning I watched as a pack of wild dogs pulled down a Puku near the water's edge. As they started feeding a hippo charged out the water and chased them off. This continued for some time until the wild dogs gave up and moved off. br

Aside from their tendencies to chase predators off hippo have been observed to  strong catch and kill antelope  strong  that have strayed into the water. Why this happens is unknown but has happened enough times to be considered a form of behaviour and not an aberration.  p 
 p class="noImagePar" Hippos are known to wander great distances at night in search of food. In Botswana I observed a hippo that had wandered too far from the Linyanti system one night and ended up in the a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za Area_Guides-travel savuti-faqs.html"  Savuti Marsh  a  area. Its time of arrival in Savuti coincided with a water crisis. br 
 br 
The waterholes were dry and many animals were milling around in confusion. The  strong hippo was stranded  strong  at one of the dry pans. The days were scorching, adding to the problem. The most fascinating part of this drama was the other animals' reaction to the hippo. br  br 
 a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za hyena-guide.html" hyenas  a  lay side by side with the  strong hippo in one of the concrete  strong  troughs in an apparent move to cool down on the concrete.  a href="http:  www.botswana.co.za elephant-guide.html" Elephant  a  would walk over, have a look then walk back to the little shade there was. br 
 br 
When the water finally came through the pipe on the third day the  strong elephants kept other animals away  strong  from the trough with the hippo, even chasing the hyenas away that were sharing the trough at the time. It was an amazing behavioral trait.The hippo recovered and disappeared during the third night.  p
