                     br 
                    Pygmy Hippopotamuses are semi- a href=".. .. glossary aquatic.html" aquatic  a  mammals. They have a body length between 1.4 and 1.6 m (4.5 - 5 ft), a tail length of approximately 15 cms (6 inches) and they weigh between 245 and 275 kgs (540 - 610 lbs).  br 
                     br 
                    Their skin is thick, smooth, hairless and dark brown black in colour. Their body is barrel shaped, they have a broad head and a large mouth. Their legs are short and stocky and they have four toes on each of their feet. Their toes are spread out and have sharp nails, but they lack any webbing. They have small ears and large, round nostrils and when they submerge underwater they are able to close their nostrils and ears to prevent water from entering them. br

                      font  font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif" To prevent their skin from cracking they have to moisten it regularly in water or mud and they also have special mucus producing skin glands. These glands excrete a pink fluid, known as blood sweat, that helps to keep their skin moist and helps prevent against infection and sunburn. br
