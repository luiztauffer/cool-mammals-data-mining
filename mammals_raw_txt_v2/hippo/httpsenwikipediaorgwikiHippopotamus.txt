 p The common  b hippopotamus  b  ( i Hippopotamus amphibius  i ), or  b hippo  b , is a large, mostly  a href=" wiki Herbivore" title="Herbivore" herbivorous  a ,  a href=" wiki List_of_semiaquatic_tetrapods" title="List of semiaquatic tetrapods" semiaquatic mammal  a  native to  a href=" wiki Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa" sub-Saharan Africa  a . It is one of only two  a href=" wiki Extant_taxon" class="mw-redirect" title="Extant taxon" extant  a   a href=" wiki Species" title="Species" species  a  in the  a href=" wiki Scientific_classification" class="mw-redirect" title="Scientific classification" family  a   a href=" wiki Hippopotamidae" title="Hippopotamidae" Hippopotamidae  a , the other being the  a href=" wiki Pygmy_hippopotamus" title="Pygmy hippopotamus" pygmy hippopotamus  a  ( i Choeropsis liberiensis  i  or  i Hexaprotodon liberiensis  i ).  The name comes from the  a href=" wiki Ancient_Greek" title="Ancient Greek" ancient Greek  a  for "river horse" ( span lang="grc" title="Ancient Greek language text" ἱπποπόταμος  span ). After the  a href=" wiki Elephant" title="Elephant" elephant  a  and  a href=" wiki Rhinoceros" title="Rhinoceros" rhinoceros  a , the common hippopotamus is the third- a href=" wiki Largest_mammals#Even-toed_Ungulates_(Artiodactyla)" class="mw-redirect" title="Largest mammals" largest type of land mammal  a  and the heaviest extant  a href=" wiki Even-toed_ungulate" title="Even-toed ungulate" artiodactyl  a . Despite their physical resemblance to  a href=" wiki Pig" title="Pig" pigs  a  and other terrestrial even-toed  a href=" wiki Ungulate" title="Ungulate" ungulates  a , the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are  a href=" wiki Cetacea" title="Cetacea" cetaceans  a  ( a href=" wiki Whale" title="Whale" whales  a ,  a href=" wiki Dolphin" title="Dolphin" dolphins  a ,  a href=" wiki Porpoise" title="Porpoise" porpoises  a , etc.) from which they diverged about 55 million years ago.
  p 
 p Common hippos are recognisable by their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large  a href=" wiki Canidae" title="Canidae" canine  a  tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for males and females respectively. Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 km h (19 mph) over short distances.
  p 
 p The common hippopotamus inhabits rivers, lakes and  a href=" wiki Mangrove" title="Mangrove" mangrove  a  swamps, where territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not  a href=" wiki Territory_(animal)" title="Territory (animal)" territorial  a  on land. The hippopotamus is among the most dangerous animals in the world as it is highly aggressive and unpredictable. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and  a href=" wiki Ivory" title="Ivory" ivory  a  canine teeth.
