 p class="headline" Discover the wild-side of Florida with endangered Florida panther, red wolves, manatees and whooping cranes, plus black bears, bobcats, and, of course, alligators.  p 
 p When Homosassa Springs was a popular train stop in the early 1900s, passengers could picnic and take a dip in the spring while train cars were being loaded up with cedar, crabs, fish and spring water. On a 1924 visit, Bruce Hoover of Chicago called it “The most beautiful river and springs in the world.” In this regard, Homosassa Springs hasn’t changed much.  p 
 p An astounding number of fresh and saltwater fish still congregate in the natural spring bowl—large jacks, snapper, snook and others. A unique underwater structure, the Underwater Observatory, allows visitors to “walk underwater” beneath the spring’s surface and watch the various fish and manatees swim about.  p 
 p The park also features a variety of captive animals such as alligators, black bears, red wolf, key deer, flamingoes, whooping cranes and the oldest hippopotamus in captivity. The native wildlife that reside in the park serve as ambassadors for their species, providing visitors face-to-face connections between the diverse Florida habitats and the animals that call those habitats home. Each with a unique life story, all of the animal inhabitants are here for the same reason: they are unable to survive in the wild on their own. Daily programs educate visitors about the various species and what can be done to protect Florida's valuable natural resources.  p
