 p style="text-align:justify" Both calves born at Terra Natura Murcia have been to the same parents, and on this occasion mother Lolita gave birth to a healthy 25-kilo calf without complications in only 30 minutes following an 8-month pregnancy. She and father El Guitarra are now the elders in a family group of 4 in the park, including the baby’s elder sister Popi, although they will not be deciding on the name of their latest addition: that will be done by followers of the park on Facebook, and the winner of the competition which has been opened will receive a special day visit package for 4 people, including free admission and interaction sessions with lemurs and lions!  p 
 p style="text-align:justify" The new youngster, whose arrival was unexpected until keepers at Terra Natura noticed several changes in Lolita’s behaviour in recent weeks, including a loss of appetite, will now stick closely to the mother’s side for the next 18 months, while El Guitarra will also keep a close eye on his progeny and react more aggressively to anything he perceives as a potential threat.  p 
 p style="text-align:justify" However, weaning in hippos takes place at approximately 6 months, after which young calves are able to fend for themselves at the age of approximately a year.  p

It´s one of a new generation of wildlife parks, in which visitors can discover the concept of what´s called "Zooinmersión."  p 
 p  br 
The aim of this is recreate a habitat which gives an experience of being at one with the wildlife viewed in the park, so to this end more than 500 examples of 50 species of vegetation have been interplanted amongst the animal  habitats, spread across an area occupying more than 165,000 square metres.  p

 p The planting not only softens the landscape, but also enables visitors to be closer to the animals and have direct human contact rather than the traditional forms of wildlife park where the animals are at a distance between visible physical barriers. img src="https:  murciatoday.com images articles 1206_directory_terra-natura-murcia-animal-wildlife-park_2_large.jpg?00514010200155300514" alt="Terra Natura Murcia Animal &amp; Wildlife Park" style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; float: right" width="175"   p 
 p The park contains over 300 animals from 50 different species, including 3 which are in grave danger of extinction, including Giraffes, Lions, Hippopotamus, Lemurs, Brown Bears, Iberian Wolves and the most exciting new addition, the White African Rhinoceros.  p

The Flight of the Bird of prey displays enable visitors to discover the beauty and skill of a great variety of birds such as the majestic flight of the Peregrine Falcon which reaches speeds of over 300 km an hour, the Eagle Owl, various types of the Harris Hawk, the Griffon Vulture and the Buzzard Eagle. One of the main aims of the park is to encourage contact and engage in interaction between animals and humans, and the falconry is a popular means of achieving this goal.  p 
 p You´ll also find an interesting selection of mammals, amongst them  the European Lynx, Mouflon and Coatis.  p

As the seasons change , activities within the park vary to reflect the time of year, and one of the most enjoyable of these is the Sea Lion Show.

 p  br 
Part of this activity is a chance to swim with the Sea Lions, in which visitors can interact by joining the sealions in the water, accompanied by a specialised instructor. br
