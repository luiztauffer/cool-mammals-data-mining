 p Hippopotamuses, the third largest terrestrial mammal, continue to decline due to widespread poaching for meat and ivory from the hippo’s long ivory canine teeth. Meanwhile, human encroachment into hippo habitats have decimated their historic range, and the species have already gone regionally extinct in three African countries. Currently, hippos are confined mostly to protected areas, and over the past 10 years their populations have declined 7-20%. The two types of hippos, the common hippo and the pygmy hippo are listed as Vulnerable and Endangered, respectively.  p

 p The incredible hippo has been a part of the African ecosystem for millions of years, once ranging from the Nile river valley to the Cape. However, due to illegal and unregulated hunting, retaliatory killings and widespread habitat loss, the remaining 125,000-148,000 common hippos are now confined to protected areas. Of the 29 countries where common hippos are still found, populations are confirmed to be declining in half of those countries.  p 
 p There are actually two types of hippo species in Africa, the large hippo, or common hippo are found throughout East Africa’s grasslands and wetlands, and the small, solitary pygmy hippo dwells in West Africa’s forests. Only 2,000-3,000 pygmy hippos likely remain in Africa.  p 
 p    p 
 p Hippos face threats from human-wildlife conflict and habitat encroachment, with hundreds being shot each year to keep them out of crops and away from homes. They are often killed for their meat under the guise of protection, and both hippo fat and their ivory canine teeth are considered valuable. As bans on elephant ivory continue to gain support thanks to the tireless work of conservationists, buyers are looking for substitutes. Hippos have carveable canine teeth, and as a result, there has been an over 530% increase in hippo teeth export annually. Hippo populations have also been impacted in areas with ongoing civil unrest, and in places of relative stability, they find themselves entangled in snares. In the DRC, a historic hippo habitat, populations have declined by 95%.  p 
 p These amphibious mammals require access to permanent water to keep their special hides moist. Common hippos live in groups of tens to hundreds, and the disappearance of a multi-ton grazer from the habitat will result in dramatic ecological impacts. Very little is known about the shy pygmy hippo, and while common hippos are listed as vulnerable and pygmy hippos endangered, both of their conservation statuses are based on a 2004 estimate recommendation. Based on trends, it is likely their populations continue to decline.  p 
 p Hippos are an incredible, ancient creature and they must be protected.  p
