 p Hippos have made their triumphant return to Dallas – and they brought their okapi pals with them! The 2.1-acre Simmons Hippo Outpost is an immersive African waterhole habitat that features a 24-foot by 8-foot underwater viewing window as part of the 120,000-gallon pool, bringing guests eye-to-nostril with the Nile hippo.  p

Hippos are the third largest land mammal, with only elephants and rhinos larger. They spend almost all of their time in the water, which they leave at dusk to graze for grass and other vegetation. Female hippo Boipelo (BOY-pa-lo) came to us from the ABQ BioPark from Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Learn all about hippos at our hippo keeper chat every day at 11:15 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.  p

While not identified as a distinct species until the early 1900s, the okapi was once thought to be related to zebra. Okapi, in fact, are members of the giraffe family! In the Dallas Zoo’s 50-year history of caring for endangered okapi, we’ve welcomed 36 calves. About 75 percent of all okapi in the Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums’ Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) are related to Dallas Zoo offspring!  strong  a href="http:  zoohoo.dallaszoo.com 2016 10 18 world-okapi-day-celebrating-our-remarkable-history " Learn more about the remarkable history of the okapi  a    strong and enjoy our okapi keeper chat every day at 2:15 p.m.  p
