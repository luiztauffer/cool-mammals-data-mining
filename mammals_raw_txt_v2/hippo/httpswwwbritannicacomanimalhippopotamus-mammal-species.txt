 p  em Hippopotamus  em  is Greek for “river horse,” and the animal has been known since ancient times. Hippopotamuses are often seen basking on the banks or sleeping in the waters of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science river" class="md-crosslink" rivers  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science lake" class="md-crosslink" lakes  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science swamp" class="md-crosslink" swamps  a  next to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science grassland" class="md-crosslink" grasslands  a . Because of their great size and aquatic habits, they are safe from most predators but  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic human-being" class="md-crosslink" human beings  a , who have long valued their hide,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic meat" class="md-crosslink" meat  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic ivory" class="md-crosslink" ivory  a  and at times have resented them for ruining crops. Once ranging over the entire  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science continent" class="md-crosslink" continent  a  and beyond, hippopotamuses (or “hippos”) now live in eastern, central, and parts of southern Africa.  p 
 p The hippopotamus has a bulky body on stumpy legs, an enormous head, a short tail, and four toes on each foot. Each toe has a nail-like hoof. Males are usually 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) long, stand 1.5 metres (5 feet) tall, and weigh 3,200 kg (3.5 tons). In terms of physical size, males are the larger sex, weighing roughly 30 percent more than females. The skin is 5 cm (2 inches) thick on the flanks but thinner elsewhere and nearly hairless. Colour is grayish brown, with pinkish underparts. The mouth is half a metre wide and can gape 150° to show the teeth. The lower  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science canine-tooth" class="md-crosslink" canines  a  are sharp and may exceed 30 cm (12 inches).  p 
 p Hippos are well adapted to aquatic life. The ears, eyes, and nostrils are located high on the head so that the rest of the body may remain submerged. The ears and nostrils can be folded shut to keep out water. The body is so dense that hippos can walk underwater, where they can hold their breath for five minutes. Although often seen basking in the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Sun" class="md-crosslink" sun  a , hippos lose water rapidly through the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science human-skin" class="md-crosslink" skin  a  and become  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science dehydration-physiology" class="md-crosslink" dehydrated  a  without periodic dips. They must also retreat to the water to keep cool, for they do not  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science sweat" class="md-crosslink" sweat  a . Numerous skin  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science gland" class="md-crosslink" glands  a  release an oily reddish or pinkish “lotion,” which led to the ancient  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary myth" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="myth" myth  a  that hippos sweat blood; this  a href="https:  www.britannica.com technology pigment" class="md-crosslink" pigment  a  actually acts as a sunblock, filtering out  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science ultraviolet-radiation" class="md-crosslink" ultraviolet radiation  a .  p 
 p Hippos favour shallow areas where they can sleep half-submerged (“rafting”). Their populations are limited by this “day living space,” which may become quite crowded; as many as 150 hippos may use one pool in the dry season. In times of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science drought" class="md-crosslink" drought  a  or  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science famine" class="md-crosslink" famine  a , they may embark on overland migrations that often result in many deaths. By night, hippos walk along familiar paths as far as 10 km (6 miles) into surrounding grasslands to feed for five or six hours. The long canines and incisors are used strictly as weapons; grazing is accomplished by grasping grass with the tough wide lips and jerking the head. Near the river, where grazing and trampling are heaviest, large areas may be denuded of all  a href="https:  www.britannica.com plant grass" class="md-crosslink" grass  a , which results in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science erosion-geology" class="md-crosslink" erosion  a . Hippos, however, eat relatively little vegetation for their size (about 35 kg [80 pounds] per night), as their  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science energy" class="md-crosslink" energy  a  requirement is low because they are buoyed in warm  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science water" class="md-crosslink" water  a  much of the time. Hippos do not chew cud but retain  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic food" class="md-crosslink" food  a  for a long time in the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science stomach" class="md-crosslink" stomach  a , where  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science protein" class="md-crosslink" protein  a  is extracted by  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science fermentation" class="md-crosslink" fermentation  a . Their  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science digestion-biology" class="md-crosslink" digestive process  a  cycles tremendous quantities of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science nutrient" class="md-crosslink" nutrients  a  into the African rivers and lakes and thereby supports the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal fish" class="md-crosslink" fish  a  that are so crucial as a protein source in the diet of the local people.  p 
 p In the wild, females (cows) become sexually mature between ages 7 and 15, and males mature slightly earlier, between ages 6 and 13. In captivity, however, members of both sexes may become sexually mature as early as ages 3 and 4. Dominant bulls more than 20 years old, however, initiate most of the  span id="ref827839"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science mating" class="md-crosslink" mating  a .  p 
 p Bulls monopolize areas in the river as mating  span id="ref827842"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science territory-ecology" class="md-crosslink" territories  a  for 12 years or more. Subordinate males are tolerated if they do not attempt to breed. Cows  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary aggregate" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="aggregate" aggregate  a  in these areas during the dry season, which is when most mating takes place. Rare battles may erupt when strange bulls invade territories in the mating season. Most aggression is  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science noise-acoustics" class="md-crosslink" noise  a , splash, bluff charges, and a yawning display of the teeth, but opponents may engage in combat by slashing upward at each other’s flanks with the lower incisors. Wounds can be fatal despite the thick skin there.  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary Adjacent" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="Adjacent" Adjacent  a   span id="ref1252191"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic territoriality" class="md-crosslink" territorial  a  bulls will stare at each other, then turn, and, with rear end out of the water, flip  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science feces" class="md-crosslink" feces  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science urine" class="md-crosslink" urine  a  in a wide arc by rapidly wagging the tail. This routine display indicates that the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science territory-ecology" class="md-crosslink autoxref" territory  a  is occupied. Territorial and subordinate males alike make dung piles along pathways leading inland, which probably function as olfactory signposts (scent markers) at night. Hippos recognize individuals by scent and sometimes follow one another nose-to-tail on night treks.  p 
 p  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science fertilization-reproduction" class="md-crosslink" Fertilization  a  results in a single calf weighing about 45 kg (99 pounds), born after a  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science gestation" class="md-crosslink" gestation  a  of eight months. The calf can close its ears and nostrils to nurse underwater; it may climb onto its mother’s back above the water to rest. It begins to eat grass by one month and is weaned at six to eight months of age. Cows produce a calf every two years. Young calves are  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary vulnerable" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="vulnerable" vulnerable  a  to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal crocodile" class="md-crosslink" crocodiles  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal lion" class="md-crosslink" lions  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal hyena" class="md-crosslink" hyenas  a . It is thought that attacks on small boats are antipredator behaviour, with the hippos mistaking the boats for crocodiles. As a result, hippos have long had a largely undeserved reputation as aggressive animals. Cows live in “schools,” but they are not permanently associated with other cows, though sometimes they maintain bonds with offspring for some years.  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science life-span" class="md-crosslink" Longevity  a  is up to 61 years in captivity but rarely more than 40 in the wild.  p 
 p Trampling and crop raiding by hippos led to early and determined efforts to exterminate them; their hides and meat were also valued. Hippos were extinct in northern Africa by 1800 and south of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Natal-historical-province-South-Africa" class="md-crosslink" Natal  a  and the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Transvaal" class="md-crosslink" Transvaal  a  by 1900. They are still fairly common in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place eastern-Africa" class="md-crosslink autoxref" East Africa  a , but populations continue to decrease continentwide. There remains a demand for hippo teeth as a fine-grained “ span id="ref1245800"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic ivory" class="md-crosslink" ivory  a ” that is easy to carve; it was once used to make  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science denture" class="md-crosslink autoxref" false teeth  a . After the international elephant ivory ban went into effect in 1989,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science predation" class="md-crosslink autoxref" hunting  a  pressure on hippos increased, and hippo populations declined. A population  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary assessment" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="assessment" assessment  a  performed in 2008 estimated that between 126,000 and 149,000 individuals remained.  p 
 p The rare  span id="ref267101"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal pygmy-hippopotamus" class="md-crosslink" pygmy hippopotamus  a  ( em Hexaprotodon liberiensis  em , also known as  em Choeropsis liberiensis  em ), the other living  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science species-taxon" class="md-crosslink autoxref" species  a  of the family Hippopotamidae, is about the size of a domestic  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal pig-mammal-group" class="md-crosslink autoxref" pig  a . The pygmy hippo is less aquatic than its larger relative, although, when pursued, it hides in water. Less  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary gregarious" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="gregarious" gregarious  a , it is seen alone or with one or two others in the lowland tropical forests of Liberia,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Cote-dIvoire" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Côte d’Ivoire  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Sierra-Leone" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Sierra Leone  a , and Guinea, along streams and in wet forests and swamps. Liberians call it a “water cow.” It eats some grasses and also fresh leaves of trees and bushes, herbs, and fallen fruits. The  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic International-Union-for-Conservation-of-Nature" class="md-crosslink autoxref" International Union for Conservation of Nature  a  has classified the pygmy hippopotamus as  span id="ref1245801"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science endangered-species" class="md-crosslink" endangered  a  since 2006.  p 
 p Morphological comparisons have historically linked  span id="ref1245802"   span Hippopotamidae to pigs (family  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal suid" class="md-crosslink" Suidae  a ) and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal peccary" class="md-crosslink" peccaries  a  (family Tayassuidae). These groups diverged from other members of the order  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal artiodactyl" class="md-crosslink" Artiodactyla  a  about 45 million years ago, but molecular studies suggest that hippos and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal cetacean" class="md-crosslink" cetaceans  a  ( a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal whale" class="md-crosslink" whales  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal dolphin-mammal" class="md-crosslink" dolphins  a ) have an earlier common ancestor and may be more closely related. A  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science fossil" class="md-crosslink" fossil  a  resembling today’s pygmy hippo dates to about 21 million years ago, in the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science Miocene-Epoch" class="md-crosslink" Miocene Epoch  a  (23 million to 5.3 million years ago). Hippos eventually reached  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Europe" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Europe  a  and Asia, though climate changes and overhunting by humans had exterminated all species outside Africa by the end of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science Pleistocene-Epoch" class="md-crosslink" Pleistocene Epoch  a  (11,700 years ago). Three species lived on  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Madagascar" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Madagascar  a  until recent times; their extinction may have coincided with the arrival of humans about 1,000 years ago.  p
