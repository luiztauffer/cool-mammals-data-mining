 p The Zoological Societyâ€™s goal this year is to raise money for a new hippo habitat. It will feature a very large pool so you can see the hippos swimming underwater. You will be closer to the hippos than ever before. The Milwaukee County Zoo will be one of only eight zoos in the United States to feature a view of hippos underwater, making the habitat a true haven for our pod of hippos.  strong THE ENTIRE HABITAT WILL BE TRANSFORMED.  strong   p 
 p The main feature of the new Hippo Home is a brand new 60,000 gallon outdoor pool. It will be 7 feet deep and almost 3 times the size of the existing outdoor watering hole. The view is sure to delight kids and families as they view hippos  strong SEPARATED ONLY BY GLASS  strong .  p 
 p The Plan is to: Create a new hippo home that is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible. The water will be recirculated once it is filtered and will save more than  strong 20 MILLION GALLONS OF WATER ANNUALLY  strong . What an amazing conservation effort!  p 
 p Our hippos will have a beach area just outside of the pool for grazing and basking in the sun.  strong THE SPACE WILL BE 3 TIMES LARGER THAN THEIR CURRENT LAND AREA.  strong   p 
 p We need to raise the funds to make sure we can provide this new haven for our hippos and a clear, up-close view for you.  p
