 p We have some very exciting news! Our 12-year-old giraffe Olivia is expecting her second baby this spring. Olivia's birth window is mid-March into late April. This baby giraffe will mark the first offspring between Olivia and 6-year-old Dave. As part of our birth plan, the animal care and veterinary staff will increase Olivia's diet as needed and do regular veterinary check-ups leading up to the birth.  p
