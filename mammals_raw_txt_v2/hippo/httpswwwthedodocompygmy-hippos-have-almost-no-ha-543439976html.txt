                    Pygmy hippos are appropriately named. The endangered semi-aquatic mammals number only about 3,000 and are a tenth of the size of hippopotamuses, their better-known and better-researched cousins. They're sneaky, nocturnal and live in the west African rainforest -- of which there is very little left.                  p

It would be one thing if researchers knew more about the species and could understand just how habitat destruction is affecting the pygmy hippos, as well as what can be done to remediate the situation. But, as researcher Wei-Yeen Yap explained, it's hard to figure out how best to protect the species because the animals are so elusive:                  p

                    Wei-Yeen and her team have made important progress toward understanding the pygmy hippos' behavior and needs, but regardless of what conclusions they're able to draw, an important first step to protecting the animals is to work on saving their habitat. "There's no habitat left â€“ it's just this tiny slither of national park and then just desert," Wei-Yeen said. "I don't think stopping deforestation will be enough to help; we need to start a reforestation and rehabilitation [program] for the entire ecosystem."                  p
