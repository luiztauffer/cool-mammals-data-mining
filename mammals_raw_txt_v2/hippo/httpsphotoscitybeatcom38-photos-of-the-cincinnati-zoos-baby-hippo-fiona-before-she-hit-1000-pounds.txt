 p Our baby is growing up. Yes, sassy little hippo Fiona is little no more — the Cincinnati Zoo's "plump princess" is about to reach a 1,000 pound weight milestone, a large achievement considering her premie birth weight was only 29 pounds.  p 
 p The clever Fiona 1K walk to celebrate this achievement will take place 9 a.m. Dec. 1 at the zoo and is limited to 1,000 Fiona fans. The $29 registration fee includes a Fiona T-shirt, a two-pack of smiley face cookies from Busken Bakery and admission to the zoo. Proceeds from the non-competitive walk will benefit the More Home to Roam capital campaign to enhance the zoo animals' habitats.  p 
 p “We thought it would be fitting to celebrate the occasion with a plus-sized party,” said zoo Director Thane Maynard in a press release. “We’re encouraging people to flaunt their Fiona fever by wearing Fiona gear or fun hippo-themed apparel.”  p 
 p Gates will open at 8 a.m. and First Watch will be on hand with breakfast bites for all walkers.  p 
 p Note: The Fiona 1K is expected to sell out quickly.  p
