 p class="text-align-center" You would never know it by watching them on land but, underwater, hippos are incredibly graceful. Watch them swim effortlessly in their giant glass-walled pool — just inches from your nose.  p 
 p At the Calgary Zoo, we’re passionate about wildlife conservation. Your donations and membership costs can go a long way towards helping us fund our efforts.  p 
 p Hippos live in many parts of Africa, south of the Sahara Desert. They spend most of the day wallowing, resting, and swimming in freshwater rivers and lakes, surrounded by grasslands.  p 
 p The Calgary Zoo’s indoor hippo tank can hold 364,000 litres. Tilapia fish help us keep it clean by feeding on hippo waste.  p
