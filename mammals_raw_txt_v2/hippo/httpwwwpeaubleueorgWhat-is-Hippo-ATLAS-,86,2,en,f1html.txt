 p 	 span style="color:#ffa500;"  strong - A geographic atlas  strong   span  br 	Seahorse and pipefish records allow us to precise their distribution along the European and Mediterranean coastal waters.  p 
 p 	 span style="color:#ffa500;"  strong - A photographic atlas  strong   span  br 	Collected photos are precious to study and illustrate seahorse and pipefish variability.  p 
 p 	 span style="color:#ffa500;"  strong - An ecological atlas  strong   span  br 	Habitat information allows to better assess their way of life and their vulnerability.  p 
 p 	Thanks to your observations and images, we will be able to improve the scientific knowledge of these mysterious animals, and thus contribute to make them better known and respected by the general public.  p

 p 	Hippo-ATLAS project benefits from a partnership with  a href="http:  doris.ffessm.fr "  span style="color:#d3d3d3;"  strong DORIS  strong   span   a  (Data for Observation, Recognition, and Identification of Sub aquatic fauna and flora), a website from FFESSM (French Federation of Submarine Studies and Sports) where you will find several data sheets on seahorse and pipefish species.  p 
 p 	Hippo-ATLAS is also central in a partnership between Peau-Bleue and the French  a href="http:  www.aires-marines.fr "  span style="color:#d3d3d3;"  strong Protected Marine Area Agency  strong   span   a , as part of a joint project on underwater participatory sciences. One more interest for the Agency is that seahorses are patrimonial species included in international conventions (OSPAR international convention on cooperation for the protection of marine environment of the North East Atlantic Ocean, Barcelona convention for the Mediterranean, CITES).  p
