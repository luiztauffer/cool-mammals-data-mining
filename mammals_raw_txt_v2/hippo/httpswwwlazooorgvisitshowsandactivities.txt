 p  strong The World of Birds Show has been delighting audiences for nearly 40 years. This free-flight show spotlights the natural behaviors and amazing abilities of its stars.  strong   p 
 p More than 20 species of birds perform in the show, including macaws, condors, vultures, crane, hornbill, hawks, owls, and eagles. Phoenix, the Harris’ hawk, preforms the most notable behavior by flying off the hill, through the turret at a tremendous speed, and landing on a trainer’s glove stationed in the stands.  p 
 p Launched by a major gift from the Angela Collier Foundation in memory of Angela Collier, the new Angela Collier World of Birds Theater re-opened to the public in 2014.  p

 p Visit the Winnick Family Children’s Zoo to get up close with our goats and sheep in the animal contact area known as Muriel’s Ranch, made possible by a generous gift from the Max H. Gluck Foundation. Fifteen sweet-tempered baby Nigerian Dwarf goats were added to the Ranch in late 2012, and the Zoo has seen newborn additions to the family of goats in the years that have followed. This species only reaches a height of around two feet, and the adults weigh in between 20 and 50 pounds. These colorful and curious species are a kid-friendly size and a must-see for the young and young-at-heart! We have brushes available for you to groom these fun domestic animals!  p 
 p Because of the sensitive nature of our work with California condors, they are not currently exhibited to the public. But Zoo guests can get incredible views of these iconic birds via live webcam feeds at the California Condor Rescue Zone, an educational, engaging interactive play space located in our Entry Plaza.  p 
 p The CCRZ is a fun, facilitated play space designed for children ages six and up. In an exciting immersive environment, children discover what it takes to protect California condors and the important role the L.A. Zoo plays in saving this amazing species.  p
