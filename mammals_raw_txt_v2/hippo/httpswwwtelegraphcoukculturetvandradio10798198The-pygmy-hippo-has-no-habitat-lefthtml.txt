 p  There are an estimated 3,000 or fewer pygmy hippopotamuses remaining in the wild, all in tiny pockets of rainforest on the west coast of Africa. This semi-aquatic mammal, on average two and a half feet tall and often just a tenth of the size overall of its better-known cousin, the hippopotamus, is one of the world’s most elusive species. Getting one on film was quite a challenge for the makers of this week’s Natural World.   p

 p  Australian ecologist Wei-Yeen Yap and a team of local field assistants spent several months in Ivory Coast studying these solitary, nocturnal animals, while attempting to capture one and fit it with a GPS tracking collar. The intense jungle mission created excitement and disappointment in almost equal measure. “It’s the unknowns out in the field that you have to keep adapting to,” explains Wei-Yeen, who was taken ill with malaria during filming.   p 
 p  Two painstaking months of searching for clues slipped by before they could make a confident estimate about a possible trail. They set up remote night vision cameras and finally got their first pay-off: clear footage of a pygmy hippo. In the documentary, we see one of the cautious creatures push its bulbous snout just into the frame of a night-vision camera, a beady eye gleaming as it picks up a human scent and freezes, before retreating back into the darkness.   p 
 p  The team eventually capture an impressive amount of footage of pygmy hippos, most likely three separate animals, but ultimately fall short of their aim to capture one of the slippery beasts.   p

 p  Up to now, there has been a lack of detailed research into the species. A small project that began in the late Eighties was all but abandoned for 10 years while civil war flared up in West Africa, and it’s only now that researchers like Wei-Yeen are returning. “It’s a really important ecosystem up there in the Upper Guinean rainforest – it’s got huge biodiversity but it’s also really highly at risk,” she says.   p 
 p  The biggest threat to the pygmy hippo population is habitat loss. strong   a href="https:  www.telegraph.co.uk news worldnews africaandindianocean cotedivoire " Ivory Coast  a    strong has one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world, having cut down almost 50 per cent of its entire rainforest cover between 2000 and 2010. “There’s no habitat left – it’s just this tiny slither of national park and then just desert,” says Wei-Yeen. “I don’t think stopping deforestation will be enough to help; we need to start a reforestation and rehabilitation programme for the entire ecosystem.”   p 
 p  With huge demand for ever-decreasing areas of fertile land, the government has found itself under pressure from foreign businesses. “Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cacao in the world, and rubber plantations are starting to take over now. The country gained its independence a long time ago but France still holds major business interests there, as do other European countries, and China is moving into the mining industry and plantations. A lot of hardwood was originally exported to Europe, and most of the cacao plantations are owned by the US and Europe.”   p

 p  Tackling this problem isn’t as simple as calling for government action, Wei-Yeen explains: “We just don’t know enough about the ecology and behaviour of the pygmy hippo to be able to answer those really basic management questions. We don’t really know what kind of environments they need, which areas might make them more susceptible to things, or which areas will be good when climate change comes – are we going to be protecting completely defunct areas that are useless as pygmy hippo habitat?”   p 
 p  Wei-Yeen believes that integrating local cultural practice into conservation management is vital to a project’s success, but in Ivory Coast quite the opposite has happened: the locals have been driven out of the rainforest in order to preserve the national park. All of the local project assistants needed permits just to enter the forest, and, bizarrely, everything they knew about the jungle they had learnt from European scientists.   p 
 p  “The locals are not allowed in there. It’s that kind of colonialist attitude that’s affected a lot of national parks in third world countries. It happens everywhere,” Wei-Yeen says.   p

 p  She is hopeful that the local project assistants will now be able to continue their work with pygmy hippos: “We put a lot of infrastructure in place and optimised a really efficient, ethical trapping method. It was really important to show them that they don’t need all this Western technology.”   p 
 p  Wei-Yeen was also keen to spend time in the local villages: “We were there for ages, drinking rum and sharing stories. People talked about when they used to wash their clothes in the river and there were pygmy hippos everywhere, but now they don’t see them anymore. They’re really worried, because they understand what this reflects – they know that yonks ago their village was surrounded by jungle, and now there’s barely any jungle left.”   p
