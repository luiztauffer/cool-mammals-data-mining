 p I saw him last Sunday on the Safari. I was amazed. I have been on the Safari many times and never saw a baby Hippo. Each safari is truly a different experience. He was lying right next to his mama and seemed so small at the time. “Truly amazing experience.  p 
 p I love him!  He’s so adorable! And my being born in August, am partial towards his name. br 
Cannot WAIT until we see him this MAY!! br 
So many beautiful baby animals to see this Spring at Animal Kingdom!!! br
