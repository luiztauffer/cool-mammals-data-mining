 p Features for our visitors will include an  span style="color: #ff6600;" Amur Tiger Trail  span  made possible by a $500,000 grant from the Minot Area Community Foundation. Along the trail, our visitors will walk under the catwalks, walk in and out of viewing range for an element of surprise and walk among the water features designed to mimic the Amur River Valley.  p

 p Our male tiger Viktor is trained to stand on his hind legs so that our veterinary staff may visually examine his underbelly. Our female tiger Krapinka will present her paw against the fence so that keepers can be sure her nails are in good health. Trained behaviors like these help to maintain the safety of our animals and staff. It also helps to keep our animals comfortable. If they are used to turning their hip, it’s less scary to receive a vaccine in the same way. The new habitat is designed to foster that relationship between animal and caregiver as well as that between a child and the wild.  p
