			rainforests, evergreen forests, mangrove swamps, grasslands, 
			savannas, temperate forests, and on the base of the Himalayan

 p class="MsoNormal" Currently there are over 80 tiger reserves in 
			India. These reserves started to be sectioned off in 1972 with the 
			help of “Project Tiger” (see Endangered Species page for details). A 
			tiger reserve or “sanctuary” as many are called, provides a 
			“natural” habitat for Bengal tigers without the fear of being 
			poached or going into extinction. Reserves ensure the conservation 
			of Bengal tigers and enable a growing and viable population.
