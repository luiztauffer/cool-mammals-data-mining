 p There are six different subspecies of tiger which are the  a href=" animals bengal-tiger " Bengal tiger  a , the  a href=" animals indochinese-tiger " Indochinese tiger  a , the  a href=" animals malayan-tiger " Malayan tiger  a , the  a href=" animals sumatran-tiger " Sumatran tiger  a , the  a href=" animals siberian-tiger " Siberian tiger  a  and the South  a href=" animals location asia china " China  a  Tiger. The  a href=" animals white-tiger " white tiger  a  is actually a  a href=" animals bengal-tiger " Bengal tiger  a  and is therefore not a subspecies itself.  p 
 p The average tiger weighs around 300kg and a tiger can stretch its body (and tail) to roughly 4 metres. Tigers hunt  a href=" animals snake " snakes  a , boar,  a href=" animals buffalo " buffalo  a ,  a href=" animals crocodile " crocodiles  a ,  a href=" animals deer " deer  a ,  a href=" animals leopard " leopards  a  and  a href=" animals camel " camels  a  and are extremely effective at catching their  a href=" reference glossary #jump-prey" prey  a  due to their silent, stalking approach and their powerful bodies.  p 
 p The tiger can reach speeds of up to 90km an hour, making the tiger extremely fast. Tigers have even  been known to conflict with rhinos and  a href=" animals elephant " elephants  a  with the tiger generally winning.  p 
 p Tigers are generally orange with black stripes although it's common to get tigers with white and sandy coloured markings. The  a href=" animals white-tiger " white tiger  a  is a rare  a href=" reference glossary #jump-type" type  a  of tiger, with bright white fur and black stripes, these tigers occur from a genetic mutation when in the mother tiger's womb. It is not certain that these  a href=" animals white-tiger " white tigers  a  will produce white  a href=" reference glossary #jump-offspring" offspring  a , many  a href=" animals white-tiger " white tigers  a  have been known to produce orange cubs.  p 
 p Today the tiger is a near  a href=" animals endangered " endangered  a   a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  with only a handful still roaming the Asian jungles. The tiger is still a completely dominant  a href=" reference glossary #jump-predator" predator  a  in it's  a href=" reference glossary #jump-environment" environment  a  particularly due to their extreme power, and ability to run, swim, jump and climb trees very effectively.   p 
 p The tiger is a highly adaptable  a href=" reference glossary #jump-animal" animal  a  with the tiger's  a href=" reference glossary #jump-territory" territory  a  ranging from Siberia, to open  a href=" reference grassland " grasslands  a  and tropical mangrove swamps in central and south-east  a href=" animals location asia " Asia  a . The tiger is also an extremely territorial  a href=" reference glossary #jump-animal" animal  a  and the tiger is generally a solitary animal.  p 
 p Due to the tiger's  a href=" reference glossary #jump-size" size  a  and the tiger's want to be solitary, the tiger often requires large areas of  a href=" reference glossary #jump-habitat" habitat  a  that can support the tiger's  a href=" reference glossary #jump-prey" prey  a  demands. Because of the tiger's need for a large  a href=" reference glossary #jump-territory" territory  a  mixed with the fact that the tiger is native to some of the more densely populated places on earth, has meant that there have been significant conflicts between tigers and humans.  p 
 p Tigers usually mate from November to April and after a  a href=" reference glossary #jump-gestation-period" gestation period  a  of just over 3 months, the female tiger gives birth to 2 or 3 tiger cubs. When the tiger cubs are first born they are blind and extremely  a href=" animals endangered vulnerable " vulnerable  a . By the time the tiger cubs is around 18 months old, it is able to hunt for itself. Tiger cubs are known to grow rapidly and can put on 100 g of  a href=" reference glossary #jump-weight" weight  a  every day. The tiger cubs usually stay with their mother until they are between 2 and 3 years old and the tiger cubs are then big enough and strong enough to venture out into the jungle to live a life of solitude.  p
