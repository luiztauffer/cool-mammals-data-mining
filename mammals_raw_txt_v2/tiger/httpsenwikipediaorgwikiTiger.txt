 p Although for the most part avoiding each other, tigers are not always territorial and relationships between individuals can be complex. An adult of either sex will sometimes share its kill with others, even those who may not be related to them.  a href=" wiki George_Schaller" title="George Schaller" George Schaller  a  observed a male share a kill with two females and four cubs. Unlike male lions, male tigers allow females and cubs to feed on the kill before the male is finished with it; all involved generally seem to behave amicably, in contrast to the competitive behaviour shown by a lion pride. sup id="cite_ref-schaller1967_62-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-schaller1967-62" [62]  a   sup  Stephen Mills described a social feeding event in Ranthambhore National Park:
