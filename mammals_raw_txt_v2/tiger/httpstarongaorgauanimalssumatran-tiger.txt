 p With as few as 400 Sumatran Tigers left, we are deadly serious about protecting this wild species and their habitat. br  br Scientific name: Panthera tigris sumatrae br Common name: Sumatran Tiger br IUCN status: CR - Critically Endangered br   p 
 p Sumatran Tigers generally hunt at dusk and can travel up to 20km in one night in search of food. Unlike other members of the cat family, the tiger cannot outrun its prey and needs to use camouflage to ambush a meal instead. This hunting method is slow and patient, stalking through dense cover until close enough to spring. They will run hoofed prey into water to slow them down. A throat bite is used and death is caused by suffocation. br    p 
 p Striking orange fur striped with black above and white underside, the stripes of a Sumatran Tiger are much closer together than in other tiger species which helps them to camouflage. The pattern of stripes is unique to each animal. With strong front paws and five toes, their sharp claws are retractable and can be pulled inside while they walk which helps to keep these important hunting tools sharp. br    p
