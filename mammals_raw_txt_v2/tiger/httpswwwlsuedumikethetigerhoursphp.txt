 p Mike the Tiger is the only live tiger living on a college campus in the U.S. The Tiger
                  Habitat is located on North Stadium Drive in Baton Rouge; the habitat sits between
                  the Bernie Moore Track Stadium and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center and is across
                  the street from Tiger Stadium. There is no fee to see Mike the Tiger.

 p Mike is outside usually every day between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. (though times may vary),
                  including weekends and holidays. Yard work is scheduled each Thursday morning, so
                  Mike remains inside until that is done. When Mike is kept inside for yard work, maintenance
                  or some other reason, it will be posted on Mike's social media platforms (facebook.com mikethetiger,
                  @mikethetiger and instagram.com mikethetiger_lsu).
