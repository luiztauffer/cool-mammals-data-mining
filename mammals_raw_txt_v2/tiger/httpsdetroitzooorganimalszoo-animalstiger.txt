 p  strong Description br 
  strong Amur tigers are the largest members of the cat family and the largest of the five remaining subspecies of tigers. They are mostly orange with black stripes. They have white markings on their ears, abdomens, paws, muzzles, cheeks and above their eyes. Large teeth and sharp claws make them deadly hunters.  p 
 p A tiger’s stripes act like its fingerprint as each stripe pattern is unique for each cat.  p 
 p A tiger’s stripes are not only on the fur but also on its skin.  p 
 p Tigers are one of the few species of cats to enjoy water.  The tiger at the Detroit Zoo can often be found splashing around in their waterfall or pool.  p
