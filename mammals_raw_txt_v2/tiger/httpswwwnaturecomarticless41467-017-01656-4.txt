 p The continuing development of improved capture–recapture (CR) modeling techniques used to study apex predators has also limited robust temporal and cross-site analyses due to different methods employed. We develop an approach to standardize older non-spatial CR and newer spatial CR density estimates and examine trends for critically endangered Sumatran tigers ( i Panthera tigris sumatrae  i ) using a meta-regression of 17 existing densities and new estimates from our own fieldwork. We find that tiger densities were 47% higher in primary versus degraded forests and, unexpectedly, increased 4.9% per yr from 1996 to 2014, likely indicating a recovery from earlier poaching. However, while tiger numbers may have temporarily risen, the total potential island-wide population declined by 16.6% from 2000 to 2012 due to forest loss and degradation and subpopulations are significantly more fragmented. Thus, despite increasing densities in smaller parks, we conclude that there are only two robust populations left with &gt;30 breeding females, indicating Sumatran tigers still face a high risk of extinction unless deforestation can be controlled.  p

CR analyses have recently been supplanted by more robust spatial capture–recapture (SCR) approaches. Thus, accurate estimation of population trends for endangered apex predators requires a method that can integrate older CR estimates with more recent SCR estimates, whilst accounting for the biases in the former and variation in error associated with every estimate.  p 
 p Here we develop an approach to characterize spatiotemporal trends in wildlife populations based on CR analyses and apply it to the critically endangered Sumatran tiger ( i Panthera tigris sumatrae  i ). We also assess three questions about Sumatran tiger ecology and conservation: how tiger densities (i) vary between different forest types (i.e., peatland versus lowland forest), (ii) vary in response to habitat disturbance (primary versus degraded forest), and (iii) vary over time. To characterize density variations and estimate populations sizes, we use a five-stage process of linked methods. First, we collated a data set of tiger densities from all published non-spatial CR studies. Second, we recalculate CR densities after adjusting their respective study areas to allow for comparisons to SCR estimates. Third, we add to this set of standardized densities the more recent SCR densities, as well as from three new CT surveys that we conducted in Sumatra’s UNESCO Heritage Site forests in 2014 (Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Fig1" 1  a , Table  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Tab1" 1  a ). Fourth, we compare the results between different forest types and through time using a meta-regression approach that accounts for the error associated with each density estimate. Finally, we extrapolate forest-type specific densities across the island’s remaining tiger-occupied forest area in 2000 and 2012 (Table  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Tab2" 2  a ) to estimate subpopulation sizes, total population size, and to identify key sites for conservation.  p

This greatly limits our ability to make island-wide assessments and efficent conservation decisions. This project fills that research gap for the Sumatran tiger while the analytic approach developed here can be widely replicated for other species routinely monitored with capture–recapture techniques.  p 
 p We find that while tiger densities have significantly increased over the last decade, the disproportionate loss of higher quality lowland and hill primary forest habitat, in combination with severe fragmentation of remaining strongholds, has offset this important conservation achievement and led to an equivocal or higher threat of extinction. We derive habitat-specific tiger densities and use past and current forest cover to estimate the change in tigers in each of Sumatra’s remaining occupied landscapes. We conclude by discussing the imminent and often irreversible threat of deforestation and fragmentation compared to the previous dominant threat of poaching, with a specific focus on the role of oil palm agriculture in driving forest loss.  p 
 p To characterize temporal and cross-site trends in tiger densities in tropical rainforests, we collated a set of previously published tiger studies and added our three new estimates from 2014. Recalculating CR densities proved crucial to interpreting results from across Sumatra ( i n  i  = 20 estimates from 11 landscapes) and also nearby in ecologically similar tropical rainforests in Peninsular Malaysia ( i n  i  = 6 estimates from four landscapes). Using uncorrected density estimates incorrectly suggested that tiger densities declined 67.0% in publications post 2010. This decline is in fact due to the switch from CR to SCR methods; densities actually increased post 2010 after we recalculated CR estimates to remove the study area bias sup  a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Tobler, M.

The CR bias arises from difficulties in sufficiently accounting for animals captured in CT grids that have home range centers in the buffer areas around grids (see Methods for details). For a given abundance of animals overlapping with CT grids ( i N  i ), a smaller CR buffer leads to smaller study areas and higher densities (Supplementary Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#MOESM1" 2  a ). Buffer widths were significantly smaller for CR studies than for SCR studies (mean 6.30 versus 11.7 km, Welsh two-sample  i t  i -test (WT), df = 14,  i P  i  &lt; 0.01). Raw tiger densities were most strongly dependent on estimated buffer widths (Linear regression:  i R  i  sup 2  sup  = 0.43,  i P  i  &lt; 0.01), and not on any underlying ecology (Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Fig2" 2  a ). To remove this bias, we recalculated all CR densities by digitizing camera trap grids in ArcGIS and then applying the SCR buffer from our fieldwork (buffer = 9.0 km, see Methods). CR densities declined from an uncorrected mean of 2.16 tigers 100 km sup 2  sup  to a corrected mean of 0.79 tigers 100 km sup 2  sup  (WT sub 14  sub :  i P  i  &lt; 0.01) and the approach was deemed effective as there were no differences between CR and SCR estimates after the correction (Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Fig2" 2  a ).  p

 p Our new fieldwork was undertaken as part of an effort to assess the contested degree to which tigers can coexist with humans in both space and time (e.g., Carter et al. sup  a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="Carter, N.

Specifically, we surveyed both continuous protected forests (national parks) and adjacent non-protected areas, mostly consisting of a matrix of tree plantations and small (&lt;5 km sup 2  sup ) forest patches (Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Fig1" 1  a , Table  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Tab1" 1  a ). Our trapping effort was 5759, 5246, and 3531 camera days in Bukit Barisan Selatan (BBS), Kerinci Seblat (KS), and Gunung Leuser (GL) national parks, respectively (Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Fig1" 1  a , Table  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Tab1" 1  a ), which is sufficient to estimate tiger densities (Supplementary Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#MOESM1" 3  a ). We report the SCR tiger densities as mean ± 1 standard error. Densities in BBS, KS, and GL were 1.94 ± 0.91 tigers 100 km sup 2  sup , 0.74 ± 0.65 tigers 100 km sup 2  sup , and 1.32 ± 0.81 tigers 100 km sup 2  sup , respectively. Densities in non-forest habitats were 0.56 ± 0.93, 0.21 ± 0.36, and 0.38 ± 0.78 tigers 100 km sup 2  sup  in GL, KS, and BBS, respectively (71% lower than continuous forest on average and also presumably contingent on there being continuous forest nearby). This indicates that while tigers regularly use human-dominated landscapes immediately outside national parks, this is a relatively poor habitat.  p 
 p We constructed meta-regression mixed models (MRMM) to evaluate if tiger densities meaningfully varied with site or study covariates, while accounting for differences in the precision of density estimates and including a random effect to account for multiple estimates nested in the same landscape ( i n  i  sub S  sub  = 20 estimates from 11 landscapes). We include estimates from Malaysia since the habitat conditions are similar to Sumatra ( i n  i  sub M  sub  = 6 estimates from four landscapes; model subscripts denote ‘S’ for Sumatra and ‘S&amp;M’ when including Malaysian estimates). Including Malaysian estimates only reinforced results from Sumatra, thus we reported results in the main text using all available data and include Sumatra-only results in Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#Fig3" 3  a . Due to the massive areas covered by many CT grids, we conservatively separated study landscapes into two forest type and two forest disturbance categories, and looked at temporal trends for both logged and unlogged forests (Supplementary Fig.  a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href=" articles s41467-017-01656-4#MOESM1" 4  a ).

We suggest our approach is better suited to population projections when large portions of the species’ occupied habitat is unsurveyed and when wide confidence intervals make reliance on any one density estimate less suitable, both of which are true for tigers in Sumatra sup  a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Walston, J. et al.

Finally, a rise in density may be caused by the inward movement of encroachment-displaced tigers from forest edges or fragments. Regardless of whether the apparent increase in tiger densities in core areas represents a real recovery or is due to a sampling artefact, any potential increase therein has been largely offset by the habitat loss and unlikely to have led to larger island-wide populations over the study period.  p 
 p Our final insight relates to how populations are monitored through time. The inability to draw inferences across CR studies has been an important limitation in predator ecology and conservation. Optimally, precisely repeated surveys using the same field and analytical methodologies would be conducted often, but this is rare in practice.

Our cross-site meta-regression approach to evaluating variation in animal densities between habitats and through time yielded a more geographically expansive and longer-term perspective on our study species than previously available. Wider application of this approach can substantially increase the value of previous CR studies, but would still benefit from more total density estimates. We foresee the approach outlined here being repeated for other elusive species and leading to methodologically consistent and defensible monitoring programs.  p

To estimate densities within continuous protected forests, we sampled at distances of 0–15 km into forest interiors. We used a single camera placement at each trapping location, versus paired cameras, which reduced the probability that all captured animals can be identified using both flanks, but partially made up for this shortcoming by collecting multiple photos per capture event (i.e., sequences or videos) to increase recognition of non-flank features (i.e., facial, chest, legs, or tail markings).

 p This study includes data obtained from a multitude of researchers in Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia and wish to acknowledge that our analyses were only possible as a result of their work. Our new fieldwork endeavors were enabled by extensive consultation with HarimauKita and their staff. Matthew Linkie and Yoan Dinata were instrumental in facilitating fieldwork and contributing density estimates. Funding was provided by the National Geographic Society from Committee for the Research and Exploration #9384–13, the Columbus Zoo Conservation Fund, the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens and Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association (GLAZA), and ZGAP Project-code:1.Sus barbatus.IDN.2014. In kind support was provided by Fauna and Flora International-Indonesia programme and the Leuser International Foundation (LIF). M.S.L. was supported by a USA-Indonesia Fulbright award.  Hariyo Wibisono provided valuable insights at early stages of the fieldwork and led many projects that produced density estimates included in our analyses. Multi-year density estimates from Sunarto were crucially important to our analyses. Edi Siarenta Sembiring led many of the data collection expeditions. Tarmizi and Eka Ramadiyanta of LIF facilitated fieldwork at Gunung Leuser National Park. Salpayanri of the Institution Conservation Society (ICS)—Solok Selatan Wahana Konservasi Masyarakat facilitated fieldwork at Kerinci Seblat. Iswandri Tanjung and Chris Decky facilitated fieldwork at Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Alison Ke helped produced maps and calculate forested areas. We also thank Matthew Linkie, Matthew D. Potts, Brad Balukjian, Lisa C. Kelley, and Steven Bellan for comments that improved earlier drafts of this paper.  p 
 p M.S.L. conceived the project and led the fieldwork, analyses, and manuscript preparation. M.S.L. and W.R.A. designed the fieldworkwork and collected the data. M.W.T. led the re-calculations of CR densities and the SCR modeling. M.S.L. and M.W.T. conducted MRMM analyses and M.S.L. led the population estimates. All authors contributed to the final manuscript.  p
