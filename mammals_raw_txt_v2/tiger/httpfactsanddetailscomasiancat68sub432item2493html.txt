 p Tigers have disappeared at a rate faster than almost any other animal except for maybe the rhinoceroses. The WWF says tigers worldwide are in serious danger of becoming extinct in the wild. During the last 100 years their numbers have collapsed by 95 percent, from 100,000 in 1900 to around 3,200. There are presently more tigers in zoos, homes and circuses than there are in the wild.  The United States is home to some 10,000 tigers, owned by zoos and private citizens.

But 100 years of human overhunting of tigers' prey, such as deer and wild pigs, and of poaching driven by demand for tigers' skins and other body parts has been catastrophic. As few as 3,200 tigers remain, living in only 7 percent of their original natural habitat. [Source:  Leonardo DiCaprio and Carter S. Roberts, Washington Post, November 7, 2010]

  p 
 p According to some sources one third of the breeding-age tigers were lost between 1986 and 1995.  Most of these losses were due to loss of habitat as a result of deforestation and human population increases and poaching to meet the demand for tiger-based Chinese medicines, suddenly affordable to Chinese that had money to buy such things as their economy was growing.

  p 
 p  Today, poaching for tiger part Chinese medicines is regarded as the biggest threat to wild tigers. Skins sell as rugs and cloaks on the black market, where a skin can fetch up to $20,000 in countries like China. Tiger skins were in high demand in Tibet where well-heeled people use them as festival costumes. In Nepal, kings used to stand on tiger skins in front of stuffed tigers for special occasions. Some affluent Nepalis have mounted tiger heads on the walls of their living rooms. Habitat destruction and depletion of prey base are also depleting tiger numbers. Deforestation and urban growth bring the cats ever-closer to human settlements — and into conflict with villagers who will hunt any wild animals near their communities or livestock.

  p 
 p There are worries that tigers might be extinct in the wild in 5 to 10 years. Three subspecies of tiger have already become extinct: the Caspian tiger, which became extinct in the 1970s;  the Javanese tiger, which became extinct in the 1980s, and Balinese tiger, which became extinct in the 1940s.  Tiger reserves in some countries may no longer hold tigers.  There are more Siberian and Chinese tigers in captivity than there are in the wild.

Counting tigers is tricky and unreliable (See Endangered Tigers).

  p

  p 
 p Counting tigers is no easy task.  Because tigers are so difficult to find in the wild, censuses are conducted by counting tiger paw prints and studying prey and feces samples in a given area; using sampling techniques to calculate in tigers they may have missed; and extrapolating that number over an area where tigers are thought to live. By making plaster casts of tiger prints researchers are able to tell one animal from another.

  p 
 p Governments and park officials sometimes inflate numbers for P.R. reasons and underestimate numbers to receive funding from organizations to help endangered tigers.  According to report on India, "State administrators appear to deliberately conceal the loss of tigers to poachers.

 p Ullas Karanth, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's India Program, told the New York Times: “The biggest threat to tiger survival is habitat destruction and the uncontrolled hunting of tiger-prey species. We have plenty of forest areas where there should be tigers, but their numbers are low there because the prey species have been hunted out by local people. So it turns out that if you want to protect tigers, you also need to protect the deer. [Source: Claudia Dreifus, New York Times, August 16, 2005]

Big cat biologists say that there is less opportunity and space for the tigers to disperse. As the Indian economy grows at a frenetic pace and the human population swells, biologists say that tiger habitat will continue to shrink, further boxing them into isolated patches. [Source:  Rama Lakshmi, Washington Post, April 24, 2011]

  p 
 p Naturalist now believe the most important factor in ensuring the survival of tigers is the prey supplies. Tigers do well in places where they are lots of deer, wild boars and other animals for them to hunt. They struggle in areas where large animals have been poached. George Schaller's pioneering 1967 study  em  The Deer and the Tiger  em  addressed this point.

  p 
 p Loss of prey rather than loss of habitat and hunting are believed to have been the main factor in the extinction of the Caspian, Bali and Javan tigers. Karnath told National Geographic, "After providing protection, management's most important role should be to build up prey base. With enough to eat, enough space, and enough protect, tigers will take care of themselves."

The wild tiger population across Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam has dropped from an estimated 1,200 in 1998---the last Year of Tiger---to around 350 today, according to the conservation group.

  p 
 p The reported cited growing demand for tiger body parts used in traditional Chinese medicine as a major factor endangering the region’s Indochinese tiger population. Infrastructure developments were also blamed by the report for fragmenting tigers’ habitats, such as roads cutting through forests. Nick Cox, coordinator of the WWF Greater Mekong tiger programme, said, “There is a potential for tiger populations in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia to become locally extinct by the next Year of the Tiger, in 2022, if we don’t step up actions to protect them.”

  p 
 p Although Indochinese tigers were once found in abundance across the Greater Mekong region, the WWF says there are now no more than 30 tigers per country in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.
The remaining populations are mainly found in mountainous border areas between Thailand and Myanmar.

  p 
 p The WWF is calling on the ministers in Hua Hin to take action to double the numbers of wild tigers by 2022. “This region has huge potential to increase tiger numbers, but only if there are bold and coordinated efforts across the region and of an unprecedented scale that can protect existing tigers, tiger prey and their habitat,” said Cox.

  p 
 p In places like Thailand and Laos, large animals have been hunted out of existence and tigers have been forced to try and survive by eating porcupines, monkeys and 40-pound munthacs---animals that are hard to catch and provide very little meat. In Laos, snares have cleared out many mammals. Tigers have to roam far to find a meal and their populations are now regarded as too small and scattered to survive in the long term.

Two thirds of the remaining forests, where tigers live, have been sold to timber concessions. By some counts two or three tigers a month were killed by mines and poachers in the 1990s. One hunter interviewed in northeast Cambodia said that he had personally shot 30 tigers.

  p 
 p Poachers in northeast Cambodia sometimes use explosives to kill tigers. They catch a pig or a game animal and tie to explosives to it. When a tiger takes the bait it detonates the explosives. Some poachers hang a monkey from a tree on top of a mine. When the tiger leaps to get the monkey it sets off the mine when it lands. The mines tend to blowout the tigers under belly leaving most of the skin and fur intact and able to fetch a good price. The bones are often the most valuable tiger parts.

  p 
 p Tiger pelts are sold for between $500 and $600 and bones ate sold for about $200 a kilogram. One Cambodian shopkeeper told Reuters, "If you want one or two skins you can have them immediately, but if you want four or five you'll have to wait."  Sometimes tigers get their revenge.

At the Wildlife Conservation Society, we won't guess. What we will say, based on scientific data, is that there are only about 115,000 square miles of forest still left in the country where tigers can thrive and breed. In most of that territory, there's been a tremendous tiger decline due to habitat degradation by local people and development activities like mines, dams and roads, and the poaching of tiger prey.

  p 
 p  “The revelation is bad news for wild tigers — already endangered by rampant poaching and shrinking habitat as India undergoes breakneck development to accommodate the staggering growth of its 1.2 billion people. That same economic development and population growth means more people — and more dogs — are coming even closer to wildlife. India will now test every tiger carcass it finds for the virus, Gopal said, while authorities also consider a massive campaign to vaccinate dogs against canine distemper. "We cannot vaccinate every dog, of course. But even 50 percent of dogs in the zones around sanctuaries would help," Gopal said. He did not give details of the plans being considered. There is no vaccine for big cats. 

  p 
 p  “The cases being found across such a huge swath of India, however, suggests the disease could already be running in the wild, experts said, though they agree much more research is needed. "These are very disturbing finds," said Dr. A.K. Sharma, head scientist at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, which performed the canine distemper lab tests. "The cases were quite distant from each other, and the latest was an area where there are no dogs. So it appears the virus is spreading." 

  p 
 p  “Since two cubs tested positive in a zoo in the Bihar state capital of Patna a year ago, Sharma and his colleagues have found at least four more cases — a red panda in the northeast state of Manipur, a wild tiger in West Bengal, a zoo lion in Darjeeling and last month a wild tiger in the Dudhwa Tiger reserve in Uttar Pradesh. "In the last case, forest guards said they saw the animal in a confused state before it died," he said. Experts said there are likely more undetected cases, since testing for canine distemper has not been routine and few animals that die in the wild are ever found. 

  p 
 p  “Canine distemper virus, a close relative of measles, is associated mostly with domestic dogs though it has infected — and ravaged — other carnivore populations. It brought the U.S. black-footed ferret to the brink of extinction in the late 1970s. In Tanzania in 1994, an epidemic likely introduced by tourists' dogs wiped out at least a third of the 3,000-strong African lion population in Serengeti National Park. The possibility of a disease like canine distemper hitting the world's last population of wild Asiatic lions was a major consideration in last year's Indian Supreme Court's decision ordering Gujarat state to safeguard the species by transferring some lions to a second, faraway sanctuary. 

  p 
 p  “While dogs can often recover from the disease, other animals including tigers, lions and leopards suffer fever, seizures and delirium before they die. There is no known cure. Some experts said it was pointless to try to limit the disease, given how closely millions of Indians live alongside wildlife. Instead, the country should focus on other, proven threats like poaching, prey loss to hunting and human encroachment into forests. "Thinking we can control this is totally unrealistic. We have to live with it now, and assess whether it's really serious yet," said Ullas Karanth, the Bangalore-based Asian science director of Wildlife Conservation Society. "What South Africa has done, quarantining huge areas and creating disease-free spaces in the wild, is not feasible here." 

  p 
 p  "This is a serious situation," said Thopsie Gopal, who has no relation to Rajesh Gopal. "Maybe tigers are eating infected dogs, or maybe it is spreading in the wild." He suggested India could resume its policy of vaccinating cattle against rinderpest, another virus similar to canine distemper. Increasing antibodies against rinderpest in the environment could help boost defenses against canine distemper, he said. "It might be too late, but might be worth trying," he said.
Indian experts also want to search living tigers for natural antibodies that could be used in creating a vaccine. But there are obvious challenges in capturing the reclusive and dangerous nighttime predators for blood tests. "It would take a lot of funding and a lot of manpower," Sharma said. "We'll see if the government agrees."
