 p A tiger will leave its mother after 2 years of age and find its own territory to roam. They reach sexual maturity at 3-4 years. Juvenile mortality is high with tigers, with about half of them not surviving to adulthood. Tigers have been known to live up to 20 years old in the wild, although a 10-year lifespan is typical.  p 
 p Tigers are sexually dimorphic; the males are a larger size than the females. The smallest subspecies of tiger is the Sumatran weighing around between 160-300 pounds, while the largest male of the Siberian (Amur) subspecies can weigh up to 660 pounds.  p

They mark their territory with scent glands on their face, spraying urine, scratching trees, feces, and vocalizing to warn competing tigers or attract mates. Tigers have a scent gland on the roof of their mouth called the Jacobsen’s Organ, where they curl their lips and stick out their tongue called a Flehmen’s Response. A variety of mammals use this organ to sense different odors, and it acts as a way of communication. Tigers use this sense to identify reproductive status, to identify competitive tiger territory, and as warning signs to stay away.  p 
 p Tigers use their tails to communicate. For example, when the tail is moved rapidly from side to side or low with an occasional twitch, they are expressing aggression. Their stripes are also useful in that they are a disruptive form of camouflage and help break up their body patterns so they do not look like one solid mass to their prey. The orange color blends in well with the surrounding environment. All tigers have different stripes and are like fingerprints. They also have white spots on the back of their ears, to mimic eyes so they cannot be ambushed by other predators. If a tiger is threatened, they twist their ears as a warning signal.  p 
 p Their coats have adapted to survive the cold with long dense fur to protect them from wind, rain, and frost. In warm areas, their fur is thinner and shorter than in colder climates. Male tigers have a scruff of fur around their faces as well. Cats have a rough surface on their tongue called papillae or rasps that remove fur or feathers from prey and also groom their coats.  p

 p  strong Historic Home Ranges:  strong  Turkey through South and Southeast Asia to far eastern shores  p 
 p  strong Current Home Ranges:  strong  South and Southeast Asia, China, Russia, Far East  p 
 p Tigers are the largest of the big cat subfamily Pantherinae which includes the big cats (tigers, lions, jaguar, leopards). They are solitary animals, meaning they live alone. They only come together in the wild to mate, or if there is a mother raising cubs. Tigers stalk their prey, capable of consuming 60-80 pounds of meat at one time.  p 
 p Human-wildlife conflict is causing unrelenting pressure for tiger survival. Poaching, habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and retaliatory killings are devastating tiger natural habitats and populations. They are forced to compete with growing human populations for space and survival. This is affecting each subspecies of tiger in their natural home range. All tiger subspecies are classified as Endangered.  p 
 p Poaching for their body parts is still a lucrative industry, with their skins and body parts being used for traditional Asian medicines. According to  a href="http:  www.nationalgeographic.com.au animals tiger-facts.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" National Geographic  a , research has shown that populations have shrunk 50% in just three tiger generations (21 to 27 years), with their range also being halved in the same amount of time (“Tiger Facts” 2015). Fragmented territories make it more difficult for tigers to find a mate, and therefore hinder their ability to increase in population size.  p

Forests are being continuously cleared for agriculture, timber, and to create roads for human development. These activities pose dire threats to tiger habitats, as they depend on vast territories to survive. Small scattered habitats, due to development, cause vulnerability to the species by decreasing the chance of survival due to lack of space and create a higher chance of inbreeding. Confining tigers in smaller spaces also increases the chance of poaching as they are forced out of protected areas to establish their own territories (“Facts”).  p 
 p As human populations continue to grow, the forests shrink and prey abundance decreases. Tigers are forced to leave protected areas in search for territory and food, and therefore show up in human-dominated areas. As those tigers begin hunting livestock for food, the local communities will kill them in retaliation, as they depend on their livestock for their livelihood. These tigers often end up for sale in black markets.  p 
 p Poaching continues to be the most immediate threat to wild tiger populations. Every part of their body is traded in illegal wildlife markets. The demand is relentless, as their body parts are used for traditional medicine, folk remedies, and also are considered a status symbol in many Asian cultures.  p 
 p The problem lies in having limited resources to protect areas in the countries where tigers live. Even places with strong enforcement of laws continue to fight with poachers. In both Indochina and China, there are thousands of acres that are empty due to the never-ending pressure from poachers, according to  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species tiger" target="_blank" rel="noopener" WWF  a  (“Facts”). When a single tiger is killed, it has a ripple effect on other tigers as well as the ecosystem. If a mother is killed, her cubs will most likely not survive. When a male tiger is poached, other males will compete for his territory, potentially leading to more death among that population.  p 
 p Tigers are an apex predator, being at the top of the food chain in the wild. They are a vital link in maintaining rich biodiversity in their surrounding ecosystems. They are an umbrella species, protecting tigers in the wild also protects many other species of flora and fauna around them. Provides ecosystem services like clean water and air, things that humans need to survive and be healthy. By protecting a single tiger, roughly 25,000 acres of forest are also protected.  p

If tigers were to go extinct, the whole ecosystem balance would collapse. Saving tigers is not only about keeping the beautiful species around, but also making sure that humans live longer by maintaining healthy ecosystems. Forests are known to provide ecological services like clean air, water, soil, temperature regulation, etc. This apex predator plays a pivotal role in ecosystem survival.  p 
 p The key to the species’ survival is the immediate protection of the remaining wild populations, and recovering large habitat and corridors for the species to roam. Natural prey populations must also be managed sustainably. Mitigating human-wildlife conflicts between locals and tiger conservation is crucial to save the species from extinction.  p 
 p In the early 1900’s, around 100,000 tigers existed in the wild throughout their natural home range. There is estimated to only be between 3,000-4,500 tigers left in the wild. They inhabit a small fraction of historic home range, with fragmented territories causing breeding difficulties. Three of the nine tiger subspecies became extinct during the 20 sup th  sup  century (Caspian, Javan, Bali), as well as the South China tiger not being seen in the wild for 25 years is considered to be functionally extinct. Below are the current tiger subspecies and numbers according to  a href="https:  defenders.org tiger basic-facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener" Defenders of Wildlife  a  (“Basic Facts About Tigers”) and  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species tiger" target="_blank" rel="noopener" WWF  a  (“Facts”).  p

In the early 1950’s there was an estimated 4,000 tigers in existence. Thousands were killed as they were thought to be a pest. Killings, habitat destruction, and fragmentation left the population in dire conditions. Even though the Chinese government banned hunting in 1979, the population did not recover. By 1996 there was thought to be only 30-80 individuals, and the subspecies has not been recorded for 25 years in the wild. The captive population of South China tigers consists of 57 individuals and show signs of inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity ( a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 15965 0" target="_blank" rel="noopener" Jackson &amp; Nowell 2008  a ).

With a restricted home range being held within watercourses and desert, the reason for extinction was due to several factors (Jackson &amp; Nowell 2011). They were ruthlessly killed in large numbers by Russian armies who cleared predators from agricultural land. Population growth and deforestation lessened the natural prey abundance.
