 p Imagine walking through a jungle. In the shadows watching you is an animal you don't notice because it is well hidden in its surroundings. You continue on, enjoying your walk, unaware that you could have been a snack for the lurking tiger.   p 
 p When you picture a tiger, you might think of it in a jungle or rainforest, but tigers are found in different kinds of  b habitats  b , or types of places where they naturally live.   p 
 p You can find tigers in:   p 
 p Tigers are  b carnivorous  b , or meat eaters, and these big cats get very hungry. They usually grab a large dinner twice a week and hunt different animals, depending on their habitat. Some of their favorite snacks include deer, wild pigs, buffalo, wild cows, elephant calves, and rhinoceroses.   p 
 p Like an all-you-can-eat pizza buffet, tigers eat as much as their stomach can hold in one sitting, and then come back to nibble on their kill during the week when they are hungry.   p 
 p Tigers and their prey also need water to live, like you do, so their habitats include ponds, swamps, rivers and streams. Although they enjoy a cool, refreshing drink, tigers also use the water in their habitat to cool off, the way you take a dip in the pool on a hot summer day.   p 
 p They are also great swimmers and sometimes wait for their dinner to stop for a drink so they can pounce.   p 
 p Tigers don't like to hang out with other tigers very much, except for mother tigers and their cubs. Depending on their habitat and how much food is available, some tigers have areas they roam and protect, called ranges, that span many miles.   p 
 p The Siberian tiger has the largest range of all tigers because it has fewer animals in its habitat, so it has to go a longer distance for food. This tiger's range has an area of about 4,000 square miles, which is about the size of the states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined!   p

 p There are six types of tigers left in the wild, and they live in small parts of India, Asia and Russia. But there used to be a lot more of them and they used to live in much larger areas before people began destroying their homes and using the land for their own use, building things like towns and farms.   p 
 p People also hunt tigers, and there are less than 5,000 left in the wild. They may eventually become  b extinct  b , or disappear forever in their natural habitat.   p 
 p Zoos and other groups are working hard to protect tigers so that they survive.   p 
 p Tigers live in different kinds of  b habitats  b  in India, Asia and Russia that include mountains, forests, mangrove swamps, rainforests, savannahs and grasslands. Tigers live alone and are  b carnivorous  b , eating meat, including deer, pigs and buffalo, depending on their habitat. Tiger habitats are shrinking because people are taking over the land and hunting them, which may cause tigers to become  b extinct  b , disappearing forever.  p
