 p The majestic tiger, once the top predator of nearly all of Asia's vast tropical and temperate forests, today faces a persistent suite of nearly overwhelming dangers in a vastly diminished range. Tigers are killed in huge numbers for their skins and bones or in retaliation for conflict with humans, their prey are killed by skilled hunters to feed an insatiable local luxury market for 'exotic' bushmeat, and their remaining forest habitats are relentlessly converted to human uses. In the face of these immense threats, WCS has developed a set of powerful strategies that has demonstrably increased tiger populations.   p

        WCS is a leader in both tiger conservation and tiger science. WCS scientists have been responsible for over 75% of all peer-reviewed published tiger research.

	WCS provides key technical support to local governments regarding tigers that assists in the creation and expansion of dozens of protected areas (PAs) across Asia, thereby protecting thousands of square kilometers of tiger habitat. In addition, WCS provides technical support and intelligence to park rangers and local enforcement agencies that enables the capture of hundreds of illegal poachers and traffickers of tigers and their prey.
  p 
 p WCS scientists collaborate with both the world's leading wildlife statisticians and local governments to create incisive, impactful tiger science, such as writing the manual on tiger and prey population monitoring that is used across all tiger range states in Asia.    p 
 p Tigers are dangerous animals that can kill domestic livestock and even humans. Furthermore, such conflict can erode public support for tigers. Wherever tigers become embroiled in serious conflict with humans, WCS operates human-tiger conflict mitigation teams that demonstrably and dramatically reduce damages to both tigers and humans.  p

	WCS has been working to protect wild tigers in Western Thailand's Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary since 2004. As a result of our efforts in this region, the population of wild tigers has increased by 50% and the Thai government has increased its commitment to managing the sanctuary by 75%. The area now serves as a national model for tiger recovery, and WCS's tactics are being replicated in neighboring protected areas.
