                     br 
                    Tigers are the largest of the four big cats. They have a body length between 1.4 and 2.8 m (4.5 - 9.25 ft), a shoulder height between 80 and 110 cms (31 - 43 inches), a tail length between 60 and 110 cms (24 - 43 inches) and they weigh between 100 and 300 kgs (220 - 660 lbs).  br 
                     br 
                    The base colour of a Tiger's coat ranges from a dark rusty orange to a lighter yellow orange and they have dark vertical stripes that are unique to each individual. Their underside and parts of their face are cream white in colour. The colour of each  a href=".. .. glossary subspecies.html" subspecies  a  of Tiger differs depending on their location, the Siberian Tiger tends to be lighter in colour with less bold stripes while the bengal tiger has a strong orange colouration with bold, dark stripes. br 
                     br 
                    The length of their fur also depends on their location. The Siberian Tiger has longer, more dense fur that enables it to stay warm in the cold climate of Siberia. Their fur length also varies with the different seasons, with it being longer during the winter months. Tigers that live in tropical locations, such as the Sumatran Tiger, tend to have shorter, less dense fur. br 
                     br 
                    Male Tigers have a ruff of fur around the back of their head and this is particularly pronounced in Siberian Tigers. Tigers have numerous thick, white whiskers and these assist them in finding their way around in the dark. Their ears are small and rounded and their eyes are round and amber in colour. Like most cats, Tigers have excellent senses of sight and hearing. They have large  a href=".. .. glossary canine_tooth.html" canine teeth  a  that are 5.5 - 6.5 cms (2.2 - 2.6 inches) in length and adult Tigers have 30 teeth in total. br 
                     br 
                    Tigers have large feet with 5 toes on their fore feet and 4 on their hind. Their claws are long and retractable being up to 10 cms (3.9 inches) in length.  br 
                     br 
                    Tigers are mainly active at dawn and dusk, they are strong swimmers and enjoy spending time in the water. Despite their size they can reach speeds of 49 - 65 km hr (35 - 40 mph) and they can leap 9 - 10 m (30 - 33 ft) in length and up to 5 m (16 ft) high. They are just behind  a href="mountain_lion.html" mountain lions  a  with regard to their jumping ability.  br 
                     br 
                    There is a well known mutation, known as chinchilla albinistic, that produces a White Tiger. These are rare in the wild but are widely bred in zoos. White Tigers are not a separate subspecies neither are they albinos, they are a colour variation of the Bengal Tiger. White tigers have a white base coat with brown stripes, a pink nose and blue eyes. br 
                     br 
                    There have also been reports of Blue Tigers and Black Tigers (mellanistic), however, these reports are unconfirmed and there has been no physical evidence that suggests their existence.  font   p 
 p  font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"  b Habitat  b  br 
                     br 
                    Tigers are found in a variety of habitats in south and east Asia. Their habitats include tropical forests, evergreen forests, woodlands, grasslands, rocky country, swamps and savannas. They prefer areas that have dense cover and access to a water source.  br 
                     br 
                    They are solitary animals and mark their territories with urine, secretions from their anal glands, faeces and scratch marks. Female Tigers have territories that are 25 - 1,600 sq. kms (10 - 618 sq. miles). Male Tigers have territories that are much larger and they will be connected to the smaller territories of several females.  br 
                     br 
                    The size of a Tiger's  a href=".. .. glossary territory.html" territory  a  is dependent on the available resources and the largest territories belong to Siberian Tigers. Tigers defend their territory strongly and will fight any strange Tiger that strays within their range. br 
                     br 
                     b Diet  b  br 
                      font  font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"  br 
                    Tigers are carnivorous, they mainly feed on medium and large sized  a href=".. .. glossary prey.html" prey  a  and their diet varies depending on their location. They prey upon  a href=".. hoofed_mammals chital.html" chital  a , sika deer, roe deer, musk deer, rusa deer, elk,  a href=".. hoofed_mammals gaur.html" gaur  a , water buffalo, wild boar, and they sometimes take smaller prey such as  a href=".. .. birds birds.html" birds  a , monkeys,  a href=".. .. reptiles reptiles.html" reptiles  a  and fish.  br 
                     br 
                    Occasionally they will kill more formidable  a href=".. .. glossary predator.html" predators  a  such as  a href="dhole.html" dholes  a ,  a href="leopard.html" leopards  a , pythons, bears and crocodiles although generally these predators will try to avoid each other. br 
                     br 
                    They will readily eat  a href=".. .. glossary carrion.html" carrion  a  and sometimes young elephants and rhinos, but fully grown adults are too dangerous to attack. They will also sometimes kill domestic animals and these Tigers are termed cattle-lifters or cattle-killers in contrast to the typical game-killers.  br 
                     br 
                    Tigers hunt alone and they ambush their prey, overpowering them from any angle and using their body size and strength to knock large prey off balance. They bite the throat of large prey and using their forelimbs, they drag it to the ground. They will then hold onto the throat until the prey dies. In the case of smaller prey they will bite the back of the neck, often breaking the spinal cord, piercing the windpipe or severing the jugular vein or carotid artery. This results in instantaneous death for the prey. br 
                     br 
                    Tigers will eat up to 40 kgs (88 lbs) of meat at a time and they will return to a large kill to feed for 3 - 6 days.  br 
                     br 
                    Tigers will rarely prey on humans but if they do there is usually a reason for it such as the Tiger is too old or perhaps injured to hunt for its natural prey. Tigers that prey on humans are known as man-eaters and they were a particular problem in India in the early part of the 20th century. A hunter called Jim Corbett tracked down and killed the Champawat Man-eating Tigress and there were also attacks from the Sunderbans Man-eaters and Tara of the Dudhwa National Park.  br

                     b Breeding  b  br 
                     br 
                    After a  a href=".. .. glossary gestation_period.html" gestation period  a  of approximately 104 days, 2 - 4 Tiger cubs are born in a den. At birth the cubs weigh approximately 1 kg (2.2 lbs) and they have their eyes and ears closed. br 
                     br 
                    When the cubs reach 8 weeks old they are ready to accompany their mother from the den and it is at this point that she starts to feed them meat. They become independent at around 18 months old but tend to stay with their mother until they are at least 2 years old. br 
                     br 
                    When they leave their mother males will move away and find their own territory, females however will stay in the same area as their mother and secure a territory close to hers. Tigers reach sexual maturity at 3 - 4 years of age. br
