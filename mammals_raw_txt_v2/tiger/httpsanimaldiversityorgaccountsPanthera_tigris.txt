They are known to occur in tropical lowland evergreen forest, monsoonal forest, dry thorn forest, scrub oak and birch woodlands, tall grass jungles, and mangrove swamps. Tigers are able to cope with a broad range of climatic variation, from warm moist areas, to areas of extreme snowfall where temperatures may be as low as –40 degrees Celsius. Tigers have been found at elevations of 3,960 meters. In general, tigers require only some vegetative cover, a source of water, and sufficient prey.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#0471b8a294e76d01f594c9115e33674f" class="citation" Mazak, 1981  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a ;  a href="#c1096af89597e80c2e7c297621301f9f" class="citation" Ullasa, 2001  a )  span   p

They have a gestation period of about 103 days (from 96 to 111 days), after which they give birth to from 1 to 7 altricial cubs. Average litter sizes are 2 to 3 young. In Siberian tigers the average litter size is 2.65 (n=123), similar averages have been found in other tiger subspecies. Newborn cubs are blind and helpless, weighing from 780 to 1600 g. The eyes do not open until 6 to 14 days after birth and the ears from 9 to 11 days after birth. The mother spends most of her time nursing the young during this vulnerable stage. Weaning occurs at 90 to 100 days old. Cubs start following their mother at about 2 months old and begin to take some solid food at that time. From 5 to 6 months old the cubs begin to take part in hunting expeditions. Cubs stay with their mother until they are 18 months to 3 years old. Young tigers do not reach sexual maturity until around 3 to 4 years of age for females and 4 to 5 years of age for males.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a ;  a href="#c1096af89597e80c2e7c297621301f9f" class="citation" Ullasa, 2001  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Tigers are solitary, the only long-term relationship is between a mother and her offspring. Tigers are most active at night, when their wild ungulate prey are most active, although they can be active at any time of the day. Tigers prefer to hunt in dense vegetation and along routes where they can move quietly. In snow, tigers select routes on frozen river beds, in paths made by ungulates, or anywhere else that has a reduced snow depth.
Tigers have tremendous leaping ability, being able to leap from 8 to 10 meters. Leaps of half that distance are more typical. Tigers are excellent swimmers and water doesn't usually act as a barrier to their movement. Tigers can easily cross rivers as wide as 6-8 km and have been known to cross a width of 29 km in the water.

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Communication among tigers is maintained by scent markings, visual signals, and vocalization. Scent markings are deposited in the form of an odorous musky liquid that is mixed with urine and sprayed on objects like grass, trees, or rocks. 
A facial expression called “flehmen” is often associated with scent detection.  During flehmen, the tongue hangs over the incisors, the nose is wrinkled, and the upper canines are bared. Flehmen is commonly seen in males that have just sniffed urine, scent marks, an estrous tigress, or a cub of their own species.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#392c92835cb35e10c6b64669090ff792" class="citation" Schaller, 1967  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a ;  a href="#b913d0ba1ae42b5dcb7de2713b5d7cfa" class="citation" Thapar, 2005  a ;  a href="#c1096af89597e80c2e7c297621301f9f" class="citation" Ullasa, 2001  a )  span   p

Schaller (1967) described a “defense threat” facial expression observed when a tiger is attacking. This involved pulling the corners of the open mouth back, exposing the canines, fattening the ears, and enlarging the pupils of the eyes. The spots on the back of their ears and their pattern of stripes may also be used in intraspecific communication.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#0471b8a294e76d01f594c9115e33674f" class="citation" Mazak, 1981  a ;  a href="#392c92835cb35e10c6b64669090ff792" class="citation" Schaller, 1967  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a ;  a href="#b913d0ba1ae42b5dcb7de2713b5d7cfa" class="citation" Thapar, 2005  a ;  a href="#c1096af89597e80c2e7c297621301f9f" class="citation" Ullasa, 2001  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Tigers can also communicate vocally with roars, growls, snarls, grunts, moans, mews, and hisses. Each sound has its own purpose, and appears to reflect the tiger's intent  or mood. For example, a tiger’s roar is usually a signal of dominance; it tells other individuals how big it is and its location. A moan communicates submission. The ability of tigers to roar comes from having a flexible hyoid apparatus and vocal fold with a thick fibro- elastic pad that allows sound to travel long distances.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#392c92835cb35e10c6b64669090ff792" class="citation" Schaller, 1967  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a ;  a href="#b913d0ba1ae42b5dcb7de2713b5d7cfa" class="citation" Thapar, 2005  a ;  a href="#c1096af89597e80c2e7c297621301f9f" class="citation" Ullasa, 2001  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Tigers prefer to hunt at night, when their ungulate prey are most active. In a study done in India by Schaller (1967), tigers were most active before 0800 and after 1600 hours. Tigers are thought to locate their prey using hearing and sight more than olfaction (Schaller, 1967). They use a stealthy approach, taking advantage of every rock, tree and bush as cover and rarely chase prey far. Tigers are silent, taking cautious steps and keeping low to the ground so they are not sighted or heard by the prey. They typically kill by ambushing prey, throwing the prey off balance with their mass as they leap onto it. Tigers are successful predators but only 1 out of 10 to 20 attacks result in a successful hunt.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#0471b8a294e76d01f594c9115e33674f" class="citation" Mazak, 1981  a ;  a href="#392c92835cb35e10c6b64669090ff792" class="citation" Schaller, 1967  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Tigers use one of two tactics when they get close enough to kill.  Small animals, weighing less than half the body weight of the tiger, are killed by a bite to the back of the neck. The canines are inserted between the neck vertebrae forcing them apart and breaking the spinal cord. For larger animals, a bite to the throat is used to crush the animal’s trachea and suffocate it. The throat bite is the safer killing tactic because it minimizes any physical assault the tiger may receive while trying to kill its prey. After the prey is taken to cover, tigers feed first on the buttocks using the carnassials to rip open the carcass.  As the tiger progresses it opens the body cavity and removes the stomach. Not all of the prey is eaten; some parts are rejected. Prey are usually dragged to cover and may be left there and revisited over several days.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#392c92835cb35e10c6b64669090ff792" class="citation" Schaller, 1967  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a )  span   p

Because human populations are rapidly increasing, competition over natural resources is increasing pressure on tigers and their habitat and increasing the likelihood of negative human-tiger interactions.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#0471b8a294e76d01f594c9115e33674f" class="citation" Mazak, 1981  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Maltese tigers (sometimes referred to as  span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species" P. t. melitensis  span , although they are not a true subspecies) are a variety of tiger that results from inbreeding.  Maltese tigers have white fur with grey hues, making them look blue from a distance. So called 'white tigers' result when a cub is born with two recessive forms of a gene, also the result of inbreeding. White tigers suffer from many problems including eye weakness, sway backs, and twisted necks.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#0471b8a294e76d01f594c9115e33674f" class="citation" Mazak, 1981  a ;  a href="#aa79d88ff1dbce3e83c6d266669bb55f" class="citation" Sunquist and Sunquist, 2002  a ;  a href="#c1096af89597e80c2e7c297621301f9f" class="citation" Ullasa, 2001  a )  span   p

 p having markings, coloration, shapes, or other features that cause an animal to be camouflaged in its natural environment;  being difficult to see or otherwise detect.  p 
 p humans benefit economically by promoting tourism that focuses on the appreciation of natural areas or animals. Ecotourism implies that there are existing programs that profit from the appreciation of natural areas or animals.  p 
 p animals that use metabolically generated heat to regulate body temperature independently of ambient temperature.  Endothermy is a synapomorphy of the Mammalia, although it may have arisen in a (now extinct) synapsid ancestor; the fossil record does not distinguish these possibilities.  Convergent in birds.  p
