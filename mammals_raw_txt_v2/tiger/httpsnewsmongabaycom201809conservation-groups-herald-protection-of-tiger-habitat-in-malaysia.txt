 p Tigers and other wildlife in Peninsular Malaysia now have a new refuge, as the state government of Terengganu recently axed plans to log more than 100 square kilometers (39 square miles) and created a state park instead.  p 
 p “This new protected area not only brings more key wildlife habitat under protection, but also protects vital forested watersheds that provide important ecosystem services to the people of Terengganu,” Sheema Abdul Aziz, a conservation ecologist and president of the Malaysia-based conservation research NGO Rimba,  a href="https:  rimbaresearch.org 2018 08 15 press-release-new-state-park-to-strengthen-biodiversity-protection-in-malaysia " data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" said in a statement  a .  p 
 p Terengganu’s chief minister, Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar, made the announcement in mid-August, designating the 103.86-square-kilometer (40.1-square-mile) Lawit-Cenana State Park in the region of Kenyir. The state government also set aside 4.32 square kilometers (1.67 square miles) of wetlands in Setiu.  p 
 p “These state parks are also identified as an important refuge for flora and fauna with several threatened species,” Ahmad said in a statement  a href="https:  www.thestar.com.my news nation 2018 08 15 terengganu-declares-two-state-parks-at-setiu-and-kenyir " data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" provided to the  em Star  em  newspaper  a .  p 
 p Lawit-Cenana is brimming with biodiversity, according to conservation groups, including carbon-rich dipterocarp forests that have been there for 130 million years, 291 species of birds including nine species of hornbill, and 18 mammal species.  p 
 p “The importance of this area simply cannot be underestimated,” Paul Salaman, an ornithologist and the CEO of Rainforest Trust, said in the statement from Rimba. “The creation of the new park is a rare and unparalleled opportunity to protect a spectacular and imperiled tropical forest harboring what is certainly one of the planet’s most awe-inspiring predators — the Critically Endangered Malayan Tiger.”  p 
 p The IUCN  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 136893 0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" moved the Malayan tiger ( em Panthera tigris jacksoni  em ) from the “endangered” category  a  in 2015.  p 
 p “These apex predators face tremendous pressure from poaching, fuelled by the illegal trade in their body parts for traditional Chinese medicine,” Gopalasamy Reuben Clements, a conservation ecologist at Malaysia’s Sunway University and vice president of Rimba, said in the statement.  p 
 p  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 7140 0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" Asian elephants  a  ( em Elephas maximus  em ),  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 21472 0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" Malayan tapirs  a  ( em Tapirus indicus  em ) and  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 12763 0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" Sunda pangolins  a  ( em Manis javanica  em ) — all of which are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN — also live in the forests of Lawit-Cenana.  p 
 p Rimba said the plan is to connect Lawit-Cenana State Park to Taman Negara National Park, which, at 4,343 square kilometers (1,677 square miles), is larger than the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Malayan tigers number between 80 and 120, according to the IUCN’s update on the subspecies in 2015, so such a large area of protected habitat could help the animal recover.  p 
 p The protection of these areas by the state is a demonstration that the recently elected officials are interested in protecting Terengganu’s natural heritage, said John Goodrich, a tiger biologist who heads the  a href="https:  www.panthera.org initiative tigers-forever" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external" Tigers Forever  a  program at the wild cat conservation NGO Panthera.  p 
 p “The designation of Malaysia’s new state park signifies a tremendous opportunity for protection and recovery of one of the last remaining tiger populations in southeast Asia,” Goodrich said in the statement. “The new Malaysian government’s invigorated focus on conservation of its tigers and other valued wildlife through the establishment of this protected area is to be applauded and replicated across the tiger’s range.”  p
