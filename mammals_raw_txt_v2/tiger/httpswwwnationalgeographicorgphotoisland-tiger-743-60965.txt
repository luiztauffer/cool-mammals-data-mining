 p Indigenous only to the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, the Sumatran tiger is a critically endangered species. Threatened by deforestation and poaching, fewer than 500 Sumatran tigers remain in the wild. The Sumatran tiger is the smallest species of tiger in the world, growing only to about 136 kilograms (300 pounds). (Siberian tigers weigh twice this.) The Sumatran tiger may have evolved to a smaller species due to its isolated island habitat, a process called insular dwarfism.  p
