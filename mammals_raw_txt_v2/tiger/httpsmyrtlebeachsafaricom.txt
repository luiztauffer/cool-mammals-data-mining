 p Weighing about 9,000 pounds, our baby girl, Bubbles, at a young 34 years old, is the most interactive African elephant in North America. We rescued her in the early 1980s, when her wild herd was killed for their ivory. Bubbles was one of the lucky few that survived. Between 1970 and 1989, African elephant populations were halved as legal “regulated” trade in ivory enabled laundering of illegal ivory from poached elephants. Even after the ban in 1989, more than 33,000 wild elephants are still killed each year. br
