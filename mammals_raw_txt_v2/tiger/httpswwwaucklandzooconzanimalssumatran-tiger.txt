 p Sumatran tigers are the smallest and most brightly coloured of the six subspecies of tiger - they're also the most endangered with fewer than 500 left in the wild.  p 
 p Their stripes provide camouflage against the shadows of their forest habitat. They use their excellent night-time vision and move slowly and quietly to stalk their prey.  p 
 p Our tigers eat chicken, horse, venison, wallaby, rabbit, beef and goat and each meaty meal contains bone and hide (fur and hair) so they can gnaw on the bones and keep their digestive systems healthy.  p 
 p Auckland Zoo is currently home to Sumatran tiger Berani (born 2008) – cared for by our dedicated team of Carnivore keepers.  p
