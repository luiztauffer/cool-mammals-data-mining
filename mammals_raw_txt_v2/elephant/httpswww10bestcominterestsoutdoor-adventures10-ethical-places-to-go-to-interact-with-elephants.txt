 p Interacting with elephants is a signature experience of visiting Asia. What most tourists don't realize, though, is that every single elephant who gives rides, paints pictures or performs in a show has been physically and emotionally abused in ways you can never unsee once you've been shown.  p 
 p To get a sense of what that entails – grab tissues because you're going to learn about the crush box – watch  a href="http:  loveandbananas.com " target="_blank" rel="noopener"  em Love and Bananas  em   a , a powerful documentary that should be required viewing. It follows the rescue of a 70-year-old, partially blind trekking elephant by Sangdeaun Lek Chailert, who was named Time magazine's Hero of Asia, and who founded Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  p 
 p Lek has been a champion for these magnificent creatures for decades, and her Save Elephants Foundation has developed the 'Saddle Off!' initiative as part of its Asian Elephants Projects. Its goal is to transform trekking camps into ethical elephant tourism experiences where the elephants' welfare comes first.  p 
 p These experiences do NOT involve rides or performances – and they are so much more meaningful. They are all about enjoying the elephants being elephants in their natural habitats, and making them comfortable by feeding them, walking with them and tending to their needs.  p 
 p If you want to interact with elephants when you're in Asia, you should only support companies connected with  a href="https:  www.asianelephantprojects.com " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Asian Elephants Projects  a . They provide meals for guests, as well, and take as good care of you as they do the elephants.  p 
 p Here are 10 places offering experiences that are life-changing for both elephants and humans.  p

 p For more than 20 years, Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, Thailand has set the standard for the ethical treatment of elephants, and is now lovingly caring for 84 rescued elephants.  p 
 p There are so many ways to come and help the elephants here – you can visit for a few hours or a whole day if your time is limited – but there's nothing like spending a week as a volunteer. Not only do you get to engage with and get to know these animals, you'll also be making a real difference in their quality of life. If you're really lucky, Lek herself will be there to share her stories with you and inspire you to become an advocate for the elephants.  p

 p For more than 20 years, Karen tribes have rented their elephants to camps but this group of owners is creating a new, honorable tradition by taking off the trekking chairs and committing to caring for these animals at their homes in Chiang Mai.  p 
 p During this day-long experience, you will meet and feed the elephants, and learn about their history. You'll be given Karen style clothing to wear while walking with the elephants as they forage for food in the forest, play in their favorite mud pit, then bathe in the river.  p

 p The first and only ethical elephant sanctuary on the island of Paklok, Phuket Elephant Sanctuary is home to a herd of rescued elephants who you can get to know individually on the website – and, even better, in person.  p 
 p Set on 30 acres of lush jungle bordering Khao Phra National Park, the sanctuary offers a variety of interactive programs designed for you to get up close and personal with the elephants. Sign up for 'In the Footsteps of Giants: One Day in the Life of an Asian Elephant' to go on a safari in the jungle, where you'll learn why these gorgeous animals are considered the gardeners of the forest.  p

 p The owner of this project, which is located near Elephant Nature Park, accompanied three females rescued from elephant riding in Kanchanaburi in south Thailand as they made their way on the difficult journey to Mae Taeng in the north, and she has seen them become happier, healthier and more relaxed under her dedicated care.  p 
 p You can spend the day with the trio, preparing and feeding them fruit, vegetables and banana-rice balls. You'll walk with them, watch them play and bathe, and you'll likely become happier, healthier and more relaxed by the end of the day, too.  p
