 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" The Performing Animal Welfare Society (PAWS) has reached yet  another milestone –  strong 35 years of working to save, care for, and advocate on  behalf of captive wild animals  strong  – including elephants, bears, and big cats. And  we owe it all to you, our supporters, who have been at our side throughout our  amazing journey to protect these animals.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;"  span class="style58"  strong Founded in 1984 by PAWS President Ed Stewart and the late Pat  Derby, PAWS has become a vital and influential organization, recognized  worldwide for its expertise in the care of captive wildlife.  strong   span  PAWS has rescued  and cared for hundreds of animals throughout the years at our three  sanctuaries, from elephants, lions, tigers and bears, to monkeys, exotic  antelope and emu. They have come from the entertainment industry, circuses and  zoos; some were once someone's exotic pet.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" Among PAWS' greatest achievements is the creation of the  2,300-acre ARK 2000 sanctuary in California, which opened in 2002. PAWS  established a new model for the care of captive wild animals by providing large  expanses of space set in nature where big cats, bears and elephants could  safely roam grassy, tree-studded hills and engage in behaviors that are  important to them. More natural environments, paired with expert husbandry and  veterinary care and the monitoring of animals 24 hours a day seven days a week,  make ARK 2000 an important example that others can emulate. While PAWS does not  believe in keeping wild animals captive, it is imperative that those animals  already in captivity be provided with the best lives possible.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;"  strong While PAWS' primary focus is the rescue and care of captive wild  animals, advocacy is another important part of our work.  strong  PAWS has always  recognized that the only way to end the suffering of captive wild animals is to  address the root problems: unrestricted breeding of exotic animals, private  ownership of exotic and indigenous wild animals, and the use of wild animals as  entertainment.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" Pat and Ed were at the forefront of efforts to investigate,  document and expose circus cruelty, including brutal training, intensive  confinement, and constant transport. In a 2011 article, "The Cruelest Show  on Earth," Mother  em Jones  em  magazine  called Pat the circus’ “no. 1 antagonist.”  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" It’s exciting to see realization of the groundwork that PAWS has  laid throughout the years, with public sentiment turning against the use of  wild animals in entertainment and protective legislation being passed at the  local and state levels. Just this year, New Jersey passed the first statewide  ban on the use of wild animals in traveling shows, and Illinois and New York  passed statewide prohibitions on the use of elephants in circuses in 2017 —  bills for which PAWS provided expert support.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" PAWS has long championed efforts to end the use of bullhooks,  the menacing weapons used to control elephants through fear and pain. When Pat  and Ed rescued their first elephant, "71", in 1986, they vowed to  never chain her or use a bullhook to manage her — and they never did, even  though it was standard practice at the time. (The more humane "protected  contact" management method was later developed and is now used exclusively  at PAWS.)  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;"  strong PAWS co-sponsored the successful effort to prohibit cruel  elephant bullhooks in California (enacted in 2017) and teamed up to ban  bullhooks in Rhode Island.  strong  In California, we worked alongside The Humane  Society of the United States and the Oakland Zoo to pass this important bill.  No California zoo with elephants was using bullhooks at the time, showing how  far we've come. But we still have farther to go. There are still zoos using  bullhooks in other states.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" We’ve also seen the world’s largest circus, the Ringling Bros.  and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, first abandon its trademark elephant acts and  then bring down its final curtain, due in part to PAWS’ successful efforts to  pass the first bullhook bans in Los Angeles and Oakland, California. These were  the first big cities to establish regulations that affected the larger circuses  and directly impacted their star attractions.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;"  strong PAWS continues its advocacy efforts on behalf of captive  wildlife, with an increased focus on big cats and bears.  strong  We also focus on  education, including through our biennial International Captive Wildlife  Conference, "Wild Animals in Captivity" college outreach program, the  PAWS e-newsletter, and ARK 2000's "Seeing the Elephant" and Open  House events.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#524A4B;" As we look back, you might say it’s been a wild ride!

 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" African elephant Lulu is truly a case study in the  transformational power of sanctuaries. She went from an elephant almost  paralyzed with fear and anxiety – literally crawling on the ground on her  elbows and knees when she saw other elephants – to being an extremely confident  member of her elephant group today.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" Lulu arrived at ARK 2000 from the San Francisco Zoo in 2005.  This was only the second trip of her life. The first was after she was captured  in Swaziland at the age of two and sold to the San Francisco Zoo. Lulu was  ripped away from her caring mother (who was likely killed in the process) and  all that she knew – freedom, the dynamic sights and sounds of the African  savanna, and a vast network of elephant kin – and sentenced to a lifetime in  captivity.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" Even with the best efforts of the elephant staff in San  Francisco, life at the zoo was stressful for Lulu. Another elephant frequently  bullied and dominated her, often trapping Lulu in a corner with no means of  escape or blocking her access to food or a barn doorway. At the same time, Lulu  fiercely lashed out at her captors, as well as inanimate objects like the truck  tire given to the elephants as “enrichment.” When Lulu first arrived at PAWS  she was fearful, becoming so anxious around other elephants that she would  squat down low to the ground, making herself as small as possible to avoid  conflict.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;"  em  strong Above: Lulu, Maggie and Toka  strong   em   span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" Elephants in nature are highly social animals, but this doesn’t  mean that all individuals will get along when forced to live together in  captivity. Wild female elephants live with their grandmothers, mothers, aunts,  sisters and their offspring. In contrast, captive elephants are usually  strangers from entirely different countries. It's hard to blame those elephants  who act out aggressively, as they are merely responding to the dysfunctional  environment of captivity – worlds away from the life they were meant to lead.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" It was PAWS’ co-founder, the late Pat Derby, who largely helped  Lulu overcome her fear. Pat and PAWS President and Co-founder Ed Stewart  believed in the power of sanctuary to heal past trauma, and to help transform  elephants into the magnificent wild animals they are by giving them a spacious  natural environment, loving care, and the freedom to choose where to go and  what to do — a safe place to just be elephants again. In Lulu’s case, it took  time, constant attention, and the special touch that Pat had with animals.  Slowly but surely, Lulu relaxed and became more comfortable with her new  elephant companions. Pat’s magic touch didn’t end with her untimely death from  cancer in 2013. Lulu's confidence has continued to grow, and her personality to  blossom.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" Seeing how far this special elephant has come, Ed calls the changes  a miracle. Today, Lulu has no fear. She confidently heads up her elephant group  that includes Maggie and T0ka as they traverse the hills of their expansive  habitat, foraging on grass and trees, mudding themselves, exploring or taking a  nap. To be clear, Lulu is  em not  em  the matriarch, a word that is  often misused by captive institutions. Matriarchs are the leaders of  their  em family  em  groups. According to ElephantVoices, the  matriarch is generally the oldest and largest adult female family member who  helps ensure the group’s survival by using her courage and wisdom in times of  crisis, her memory of places and individuals during difficult times, and her  social skills to maintain and reinforce the close bonds within her family.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" At age 52, Lulu is the second oldest African elephant in North  America. Had she been left in her native home, it's likely Lulu would still be  reproducing and bringing more elephants into her family and the greater  elephant population.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" Lulu may be our smallest African elephant at PAWS, but she’s  made the biggest transformation of all.  span   p 
 p class="style156 home_left_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;color:#211E1E;" PAWS is honored to know and care for this very special elephant.   em  strong We thank all of our supporters for helping us provide Lulu – affectionately  called "Little Lu" by Ed, Pat, and the elephant staff – and all of  the elephants at PAWS with as close to a natural habitat home as  possible.  strong   em   span   p

But her spirit  continues to live in PAWS’ rescue, sanctuary, and advocacy work.  span   p 
 p class="home_left_body_text_indent style149" Pat’s bravery and vision for a better life for  captive wildlife helped lay the groundwork for the profound changes we are  seeing today, including the public’s increasing rejection of the use of wild  animals in entertainment, whether elephants and tigers in circuses or orcas in  marine parks, and the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus coming to  an end. Her battle against the use of cruel elephhant bullhooks has resulted in  statewide bans in California and Rhode Island, with PAWS playing an integral role  in their passage.  p 
 p class="home_left_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong Pat remains an inspiration to everyone at PAWS and to the  greater animal protection community.  strong  Her determination and fighting spirit  continue to drive PAWS’ efforts to create a more just and humane world for  captive wild animals, each and every day.  p

Championed by Representatives  Michael Quigley of Illinois, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and 52 bipartisan  co-sponsors, the bill would keep dangerous big cats like tigers, lions,  leopards and cougars out of private hands and prohibit the use of big cat cubs  for the public to pet, feed, take photos and play with. Cub petting attractions  cause immeasurable suffering and threaten human safety. “Surplus” big cats  produced by these operations can fuel the illegal market for animal parts and  seriously undermine efforts to conserve these iconic animals. Currently, there  is a patchwork of state laws regulating private ownership of big cats – and  some states have no laws at all. A federal law is necessary to end the  unregulated trade and nationwide abuse of big cats.  span   p

 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" Two years ago Alka (above), a 20-year-old female tiger who lives at our ARK 2000 sanctuary, was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, a condition that is common in both wild and domestic older cats. Since her diagnosis she has benefited from special medications and nutritional supplements to support kidney function, as well as extra TLC from PAWS' staff. br 
   br 
  Regular health checkups are part of the excellent veterinary care provided for all of PAWS' animals. Earlier this month it was Alka's turn. Although we have an on-site veterinary clinic, it is sometimes advantageous to provide medical care in the area where an animal lives. Because of Alka's advanced age and health status our veterinarians wanted to make her procedure as quick and as stress free as possible. Most of the veterinary equipment we use in the Pat Derby Animal Wellness Center at ARK 2000 is portable, enabling us to provide quality medical care in a field setting.  p

 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" On January 24th our doctors (above) made a big cat "house call" to the tiger habitat area of the sanctuary. While Alka slept safely under general anesthesia, PAWS' veterinary staff trimmed her claws, collected blood samples, and administered treatments. She recovered quickly from her exam, and was back to her playful, active self the next morning. br

 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;"  I recently heard about a comment made by a zoo employee, who  said that PAWS’ ARK 2000 sanctuary is “just a bigger zoo.” My immediate  response was: How superficial! That person  em really  em  doesn’t  understand what a sanctuary is all about. Obviously, space is important,  especially when you’re caring for the planet’s largest land mammal. Elephants  need room to move and stay healthy. But there are many factors that distinguish  PAWS from other captive institutions.  span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Animals come first  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" We are here to serve the wild animals in our care; their welfare  is our primary concern. PAWS holds the highest standards of care for the  animals, provided by a dedicated caregiver staff and veterinary team. The  animals are cared for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and treated with the respect  they deserve.  span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Different role of confinement  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" At ARK 2000 we use confinement to protect and better serve the  animals, rather than control and display them for human amusement. PAWS openly  acknowledges that even the greatly improved conditions we provide are still not  enough to meet the needs of wild animals. As PAWS President Ed Stewart has  said,   span  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" "The only “state of the art” place for elephants, bears,  big cats and other animals is the wild."  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Safe haven for life  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" A true captive wildlife sanctuary does not breed, buy, trade,  sell or otherwise exploit animals. The animals who come to ARK 2000 will remain  in our care for the rest of their lives. Important social bonds are respected  and will remain undisturbed.  span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Focus on the individual  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Our animals do not perform, and the public is never in direct  contact with them – no selfies, feeding, or other so-called “educational”  encounters. PAWS' focus is on the individual for the sake of that animal only.  They are not ambassadors for their species nor are they on display to send a  message. If there is any message, it is that the situations these animals were  rescued from, and the abuse and deprivations some of them suffered, should not  be allowed to exist.  span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Dynamic spaces  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Larger spaces allow for more environmental complexity and more  choice for the animals, whether it is engaging in self-directed activities or  choosing to be closer to or farther from companions. At ARK 2000 the animals  are immersed in complex natural areas that change with the seasons, effecting  different behavioral opportunities and sensory experiences.  span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" Quiet of nature  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;" A  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;"  large, natural habitat sanctuary offers subtle benefits: the  quiet of living in nature, more intrusion-free lives, the relaxation that comes  from no longer being exposed to the pressures of close confinement and social  stress, privacy, and expanded visual, auditory and olfactory experiences.  span   p

 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" PAWS strives to help elephants be elephants, tigers be tigers,  and bears be bears. Natural environments filled with grass, shady trees, bushes  and lakes allow the animals to actively engage in instinctive behaviors such as  foraging, swimming, exploring, climbing, socializing, or simply napping in the  sun. Our patient and caring staff is there to support the animals and enable  their remarkable transformation to the vibrant and thriving animals they are  today.  span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-bottom: 0;"  strong  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" View of captivity  span   strong   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149" style="margin-top: 0;"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" PAWS seeks to create a deeper understanding of the problematic  nature of captivity for wild animals and works to end the systems of abuse and  exploitation that have created the need for sanctuaries to begin with.  Captivity is not normal and we should not idealize it, even with the best of  conditions.  strong  em Wild animals belong in the wild, protected and  respected.  em   strong   span   p 
 p class="home_right_body_text_indent style149"  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;" As you can see, PAWS is much, much more than just a “bigger  zoo.” It is a place that offers a new lease on life for the elephants, big  cats, bears and other wild animals currently in our care – and those yet to  come. It is also a place where each animal is respected as an individual with  her or his own inherent value, and whose welfare and needs will always come  first.  span  span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:11px;"    span   p
