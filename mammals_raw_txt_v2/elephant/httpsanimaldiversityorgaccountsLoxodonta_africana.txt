 p audience="advanced intermediate" The range of African elephants ( span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species" Loxodonta africana  span ) is patchily distributed across central and southern Africa in the Ethiopian Region. Remnant populations exist as far northwest as Guinea-Bissau and as far northeast as Ethiopia. Disjunct populations exist southward into northern South Africa, and include contiguous populations in Gabon, Tanzania, Botswana, and Zambia. Once present in Burundi, Gambia, and Mauritania, they've now been extirpated from those countries. These elephants were extirpated from Swaziland, as well, but have been re-introduced here in recent years.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#A5FBE797-7B5C-11E6-BDC5-A820662394EA" class="citation" Blanc, 2008  a ;  a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#8CC39D5E-7B4B-11E6-BF00-A820662394EA" class="citation" Thomas, et al., 2008  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants are found in many habitats of Africa such as savannas, rain forests, woodlands, scrub forests, occasionally deserts, and beaches. However, due to poaching threats protected sanctuaries are their main habitats. Within these sanctuaries, these elephants will inhabit areas that have sources of water and abundant vegetation for foraging. Across these habitats, the elevation level ranges from sea level (0 meters) to 4000 meters.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#7F9FB3AE-7DE6-11E6-A94D-A820662394EA" class="citation" Duffy, et al., 2011  a ;  a href="#16BCB7BA-7DE6-11E6-826B-A820662394EA" class="citation" Harris, et al., 2008  a ;  a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#2DC15A80-7DE4-11E6-8E8C-A820662394EA" class="citation" Mashintonio, et al., 2014  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Currently, African elephants are the largest terrestrial organism. Female elephants can range from 2,000 to 3,500kg in mass and stand 2.2 to 2.6m at shoulder height. Male elephants are larger, ranging from 4,500 to 6,100kg in mass and standing 3.2 to 4m at shoulder height. Distinguishing characteristics between the sexes include head shape, width of forehead, saddle-back vs straight back, and tusk size. Males are broader with a curvy build. Both sexes have two thick, ivory tusks which are curved and can reach up to 350 cm in length. African elephants have muscular trunks that are able to grab objects and can be used for breathing purposes. They can grab objects due to the unique shape at the end of the trunk. Their sizable ears are triangular and can help keep them cool in the hot, summer months.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants have creased, gray skin covered with papillae. The thick (up to 30 mm), immobile skin covers the majority of the body, while bumpy skin covers areas that require a lot of movement. Smooth skin can be found on delicate areas of the body. Hair that varies in color, length, and thickness can be found along the body. Hair that grows along the back and tail is flattened dark hair that can grow to 0.80 m in length. Hair around the eyes is long in order to prevent foreign objects from entering the eyes. Calves have different hair coloring and texture. Their hair is softer with a lighter tone such as a red or brown.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" The dental formula for African elephants is i 1 0, c 0 0, p 3 3, m 3 3. At birth, calves do not have tusks but instead have temporary premaxillary incisors. These incisors are replaced at about a year of age with incisors that will ultimately form the tusks. Adult African elephants have lophodont dentition, with 6 molars that grow and move forward, like on a conveyor belt. They are worn down, lost, and replaced throughout their lives. Once the sixth set of molars is worn down, there are no additional teeth to replace them and the elephant is not able to process forage.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#8EF5FC3A-7E86-11E6-A25A-A820662394EA" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" The estrus state is how bulls know if cows are ready to mate. This is done by a scent in female urine and genital area.  During the courtship process, bulls approach females and attempts to use their trunk to stroke her.  Bulls will put up a fight in order to mate, by chasing the females if they retreat. When females stop retreating, they will join the bulls in stroking each other with their trunks.  The courtship continues by females surrendering their hindquarters to the males.  Bulls then mount the females to begin mating. The males will thrust repeatedly into the females for up to 2 mins. While females are in an estrus state, they may mate with several different bulls, and are considered polygynandrous. They are cooperative breeders, in which females have help raising young by other members of the family or "clan."  span class="citations"  ( a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#2BD520E1-75DC-11E6-83B5-A820662394EA" class="citation" Poole, et al., 2007  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants are viviparous animals, meaning that they birth their young live. They breed year-round with no seasonal differences. The number of offspring is usually limited to one for each birthing period but in rare cases, twins may be born. They breed once every 3-9 years, and will give birth to an average of four calves in their lifetime. The gestation period is about 22 months but is strongly influenced by environmental factors. The gestation period may be shorter if the environmental factors are favorable for newborns survival. Newborn African elephants will weigh between 90-120 kg, with 100 kg being the average birth weight. Offspring are  completely dependent on their mother's milk until they are weaned at four months, but continue to occasionally drink their mother's milk for up to three years. Young African elephants will gain their full independence around eight years of age. Sexual maturity occurs at different ages for males and females. Males will reach sexual maturity around 20 years of age, while females will reach sexual maturity around 11 years of age.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#07F1BA35-8A62-11E6-B772-A820662394EA" class="citation" Hildebrandt, et al., 2006  a ;  a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#2BD520E1-75DC-11E6-83B5-A820662394EA" class="citation" Poole, et al., 2007  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" In African elephant herds, primarily the mother and other females assist in taking care of the young. When female elephants give birth, they will move away from the herd in order to allow space for the offspring. When they return, all members of the herd will inspect the new elephant thoroughly. Until young elephants are around 4 years of age, they will closely follow their mother. During this time, mothers will feed their young through breast milk and help them move around obstacles. Until young offspring are independent, around 8 years of age, they will depend on the rest of the herd to teach them how to use their trunks, forage for food, and move around tough obstacles. Maternal position only affects the young if the mother is the leader of the herd, in which case, the young will be the next leader of the herd.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#3C75AD4A-8A61-11E6-AE50-A820662394EA" class="citation" Miller and Andrews, 2013  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants generally are slow moving creatures. Their regular pace is 6 km hour but, they can reach speeds of up to 24 km hour when running. How much they travel each day depends on the amount of resources in close proximity that they require; the average walking distance for African elephants is around 10 km a day. Before African elephant populations were constricted to large reservations for protection, they migrated hundreds of kilometers seasonally, from high to low altitudes and vice versa.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants are active animals for the majority of time in a 24-hour period, due to the amount of food they must consume each day. They are dormant in the early morning hours with an additional sleep midday for a total of 4 hours of sleep every day. During this time they scavenge for food and groom themselves. Grooming consist of African elephants using their trunks to cover themselves with mud or water, and the process helps them maintain hydration.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Female African elephants are social animals that live in herds of 6 to 70 members. These herds have a matriarchal order, and consist of females (cows) and their young. The alpha elephant in these herds tends to be the biggest and most dominant. Male African elephants (bulls) tend to only live within a herd if they are not old enough to go out on their own or for mating purposes. Bulls will live a life in solitary or with a few other bulls.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#C3C3C7DE-7696-11E6-8BF5-A820662394EA" class="citation" Greco, et al., 2016  a ;  a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#12FB8A14-769D-11E6-8E54-A820662394EA" class="citation" Lee and Moss, 2012  a ;  a href="#92BCC45E-75DA-11E6-A31E-A820662394EA" class="citation" Miller, et al., 2016  a ;  a href="#5A73B28C-ADC1-11E6-BEBE-A820662394EA" class="citation" Thouless, 1996  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants communicate acoustically with others of their species. Many of their calls are low frequency calls of ca. 20Hz. They can make a variety of calls including rumble, trumpet, snort, roar, bark, and grunt. Soltis (2010) reports 3 other calls made by these elephants. They include "rev, croak, and chuff." A trumpet, roar, or growl could show signs of aggression. A "soft chirp" shows submission or intimidation. Infant elephants will gurgle during play and squeal when frightened. The African elephants can hear one of these calls from over 2km away. They will make these calls to warn or gather others in their herd or to signal they are ready to mate. African elephants watch and listen to their surrounding environment for signs of something amiss. They communicate visually by using their trunks or ears to signal other herd members. Tactile communication is between a mother and her child or two elephants trying to mate. Forms of chemical communication along with scent marking among African elephants is done by males who are mating with the females in a clan. Around the clan the males will mark trees or bushes with their tusks or by secreting a substance onto the bush.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a ;  a href="#887F83C5-769C-11E6-8F86-A820662394EA" class="citation" O’Connell-Rodwell, et al., 2006  a ;  a href="#E638958A-7699-11E6-A15D-A820662394EA" class="citation" Soltis, 2010  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants have a herbivorous diet consisting of tree foliage, fruits, herbs, grasses, and wood including roots, twigs, and bark. Their source of fiber comes from chewing on bark but not digesting the bark itself. In order to obtain bark or roots, African elephants will overturn a tree to for easier access. Using their trunks as a temporary container or holding, African elephants use their trunks to gather water and shoot it into their mouths. African elephants will feed continuously throughout the day, eating opportunistically. They must consume around 50 gallons of water everyday in order to stay hydrated.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" African elephants are both browsers and grazers. Depending on the season and location, herds may depend more on one or the other feeding technique. Typically during the wet seasons, African elephants are more particular about they consume. During this season, they are more likely to forage on grasses. However, during the dry seasons when food is less abundant, they will be more flexible with what they consume. During both seasons, African elephants tend to pick food sources that are high in nutritional content.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#348816A3-75DD-11E6-89FC-A820662394EA" class="citation" Archie, et al., 2006  a ;  a href="#20FD9819-ACE0-11E6-9496-A820662394EA" class="citation" Chafota and Owen-Smith, 2012  a ;  a href="#27BE3C5C-ACDD-11E6-988B-A820662394EA" class="citation" Codron, et al., 2006  a ;  a href="#C82D369C-7695-11E6-8021-A820662394EA" class="citation" Codron, et al., 2013  a ;  a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a )  span   p

African elephants in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II, while African elephants in other countries are listed in Appendix I. Appendix I means the species is in danger of extinction. This Appendix protects the species by making international trade illegal when dealing with African elephants. Appendix II states that the species is not endangered, but could become so if poaching is not regulated. The US Federal List have listed African elephants as a "Threatened" species.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" The reason some elephant populations are in decline in certain countries is because hunting is legal in these countries. However, illegal poaching that is not prosecuted has the same negative impact. Elephants are sold and bought legally or illegally for their hides, fur, tusks, and meat. Despite an international ban on the sale of ivory since 1989, trade in illegal ivory doubled from 2007-2014. Organized crime combined with corrupt government officials makes it increasingly difficult to punish offenders.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Another reason for the decline of African elephants is that they are losing their habitats due to human development and expansion.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" In order to combat further decline of African elephants, some populations have been moved to protected areas to prevent poaching. However, about 70% of the current range is unprotected lands. So, threats are on-going. Some management efforts have been successful at increasing local populations, so much so that contraception or trap-and-relocate programs had to be implemented to sustain the habitat. Another hardship is that herds are treated differently across political boundaries - the legality of hunting, the locals' attitudes towards elephants, and the permissability of or non-action to combat illegal poaching all affect the populations. Larger-scale conservation plans that cross country boundaries may address some of these issues.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#620FF05C-75E0-11E6-A6A9-A820662394EA" class="citation" Bennett, 2015  a ;  a href="#A5FBE797-7B5C-11E6-BDC5-A820662394EA" class="citation" Blanc, 2008  a ;  a href="#DFAB61CC-7B4C-11E6-8930-A820662394EA" class="citation" Laursen and Bekoff, 1978  a )  span   p
