 largest living land animals are the elephants.  a class="reflink" href=" students article mammal 275650" Mammals  a  of Africa and Asia, they live in habitats ranging from thick rain forests to savannas. The great size of elephants and the thickness and toughness of their skins protect them from most other animals. Since they have few enemies to fear, elephants are usually peaceful and easygoing. They show great affection for one another, and females spend their lives as members of a family herd.  p

belong to the order Proboscidea and the family Elephantidae. The earliest members of the order developed in Eocene or Oligocene times, as long ago as 54 million years. The  a class="reflink" href=" students article mammoth-and-mastodon 275651" mammoths  a  were close relatives of elephants, and the mastodons were more distant ones. The most prominent physical feature unique to the members of Proboscidea is the trunk, or proboscis. One of the most versatile organs to have evolved among mammals, the trunk is used for breathing, drinking, and reaching for food.

Elephants live in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. They are found most often in savannas, grasslands, and forests, but they also live in deserts, swamps, and mountains. Though African elephants once ranged throughout the continent, today they are found mostly in reserves south of the Sahara. The more widespread of the two African species is the savanna, or bush, elephant ( em Loxodonta africana  em ), which lives in dry woodlands and savannas. The African forest elephant ( em L. cyclotis  em ) lives in tropical rain forests. The range of the Asian elephant ( em Elephas maximus  em ) extends through the forested parts of Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Malay peninsula to the island of Sumatra in Indonesia.  p

The largest of the three elephant species is the African savanna elephant, which weighs up to 16,500 pounds (7,500 kilograms) and stands 10–13 feet (3–4 meters) tall at the shoulder. The African forest elephant rarely grows taller than 8 feet (2.4 meters). The Asian elephant weighs about 12,000 pounds (5,500 kilograms) and stands about 10 feet (3 meters) tall. African elephants have much larger ears, which they flap to cool off. All species have grayish to brown skin, with sparse, coarse body hair. The skin is loose, wrinkled, and very thick.  p 
 p An elephant’s legs are long and massive. The foot closely resembles the plantigrade foot of a human, except that the heelbone rests on a thick pad of flesh. Thus the elephant’s hind leg has no conspicuous heel or hock joint as does the hind leg of a horse or dog. The free joint is the knee, and elephants are one of the few animals that can kneel on their hind legs. An African elephant has four hooves on the forefoot and three on the hind foot. An Asian elephant has five hooves on the forefoot and four (sometimes five) on the hind foot.  p

An elephant’s trunk is an extension of the nose and upper lip combined. The two tubes of the nostrils, surrounded by muscle, run the whole length. The trunk is an extraordinarily powerful and yet delicate instrument. The upper side is tough and is often used for pushing, but the under side is very sensitive. At the tip of the trunk are flaplike “fingers” that enable the elephant to perform amazingly precise tasks, such as cracking a peanut open, blowing away the shell, and putting the kernel in the mouth. African elephants have two such fingers; Asian elephants have one. An Asian elephant most often curls the tip of its trunk around an item and picks it up in a method called the “grasp,” whereas the African elephant uses the “pinch,” picking up objects as a human does using the thumb and index finger.  p 
 p Elephants use the trunk like a hand in other ways as well. They hold branches and scratch themselves in places that the trunk and tail cannot reach. A threatened elephant sometimes wields large branches or throws objects with its trunk. When elephants meet, one may touch the face of the other, or they will intertwine trunks. This “trunk-shake” can be compared to a human handshake.  p 
 p An elephant guards its trunk carefully and never strikes down with it in fighting. The common idea that an elephant uses its trunk in this way arose from its behavior when it suspects danger. Because its eyesight is poor, an elephant relies for warning on its keen senses of smell and hearing. Hence, when an elephant is suspicious, it raises its ears to catch the slightest sound and thrusts its trunk outward to probe the air with noisy sniffs. But when charging or defending itself, it curls up its trunk out of harm’s way.  p 
 p Breathing, drinking, and eating are all vital functions of the trunk. An elephant breathes mostly through the trunk rather than the mouth. It drinks by drawing water halfway up the trunk and then squirting it down the throat. It eats by grasping vegetation with the end of the trunk and then placing it into the mouth.  p 
 p Elephant tusks are enlarged incisor teeth. Virtually all African males and most females have tusks; some Asian males and nearly all females are tuskless. The tusks are second teeth that grow out after the baby elephant’s tiny milk tusks are shed. The  a class="reflink" href=" students article ivory 275108" ivory  a  of which they are composed is pure dentine, with a short cap of enamel at the tip that is soon scraped off.  p 
 p Elephants

 use their tusks for fighting, digging, lifting objects, gathering food, and stripping bark to eat from trees. The tusks keep on growing as long as an elephant lives. If an elephant uses them a great deal, they wear away at the points as they grow at the roots. Because one tusk is likely to be used more than the other in digging up roots, the two are seldom of equal length. The heaviest known single tusk weighs 235 pounds; the longest measures 11 feet, 5 inches. The average tusk is much smaller, weighing under 100 pounds (45 kilograms) in African savanna elephants and less in the other species. An elephant burdened with very heavy tusks may have to abandon the family herd because their weight prevents the elephant from keeping up.  p 
 p An elephant has six molars (grinding teeth) on each side of the upper jaw and six on the lower jaw, but only one or two of the six pairs are in use at the same time. As those in front are worn away, the successively larger molars behind come into place. Thus an old elephant may be left with only a single huge molar above and one below on each side.  p 
 p 


Females and young male elephants live in small family herds. The typical herd contains 20 to 40 females (cows) of all ages. The leader is usually a mature cow. She is most likely to maintain an even temper. Males remain with the cows until they reach puberty, at about 12 to 15 years of age.  p 
 p Adult males (bulls) usually live alone or in temporary all-male groups of up to seven members. Although the males are generally peaceful, they sometimes behave erratically during their mating periods. When a bull goes musth, as it is called, he may trample down everything that crosses his path. If he causes too much disturbance, his relatives drive him out of the herd. Usually he recovers and returns. Sometimes, however, he becomes a lone rogue elephant—a dangerous outcast that often attacks people or destroys villages.  p 
 p Elephants are active during both the day and the night, though they normally rest during the hottest hours of the day. During that time the members of a family herd huddle together in any shade they can find and sleep standing up. Toward sundown the herd walks to the nearest river, lake, or water hole to drink and bathe. The pace is set so that even the very young and the very old can keep up. If a mother with a baby falls behind, several other members of the herd will remain to protect them.  p 
 p 


Adult elephants may eat more than 500 pounds (225 kilograms) of vegetation daily. As the herd moves along, the elephants push down young trees with their shoulders and chests or uproot them with their tusks to feed on the tender roots, twigs, and leaves. In open meadows they gather up tufts of grass with their trunks and stuff them into their mouths. At times a herd will invade the fields of farmers to feed on bean plants, millet, banana trees, and other crops, but most will never enter villages. Only the solitary rogue elephants do this.  p 
 p Elephants migrate seasonally according to the availability of food and water. A herd may range over a 50-mile (80-kilometer) radius in the course of a single season. Seldom does it sleep in the same place for two days in succession. Bulls of different herds occasionally fight when they meet, but usually herds mingle on friendly terms. Vast groups of elephants made up of many family herds sometimes travel over the same route toward new feeding grounds.  p 
 p Elephants seldom run as fast as 15 miles (24 kilometers) an hour, or about half the speed of a good running horse. A charging African elephant, however, can run at a speed of 25 miles (40 kilometers) an hour. Their running gait is similar to their walk—a shuffling stride. They cannot trot, gallop, or jump. A deep ditch only 7 feet (2 meters) wide stops them, for this is wider than their longest stride. They are, however, at home in deep water and can swim for six hours at a time. They sink almost out of sight, with the trunk held up high for air.  p 
 p 


Female elephants tend to choose males in musth for mating. Gestation is the longest of any mammal, lasting 18 to 22 months. The female usually gives birth to a single young, though twins sometimes occur. A newborn elephant is about 3 feet (1 meter) tall and weighs about 200 pounds (90 kilograms). It has a sparse coat of woolly hair, which gradually disappears. It takes its mother’s milk with its mouth, not with its trunk. The young elephant is nursed by its mother for about two years and remains under her protection for two years more. Female elephants generally bear young once every four or five years.  p 
 p Elephants can live to 80 years of age or more in captivity but live to only about 60 in the wild. Evidence does not support the stories of so-called “elephant graveyards,” in which elephants supposedly gather to die.  p

The importance of elephants as ceremonial and work animals can be traced far back in history. Historical records of tamed Asian elephants date to the Indus Valley civilization of the 3rd millennium  span class="smallcaps" bc  span . Since then skilled trainers called mahouts have lived and worked closely with elephants for many years, developing a very strong bond. Commanded by a mahout, an elephant can do such work as pushing heavy loads with its head, pulling with a harness, or dragging logs with a cable that it holds in its teeth. Work elephants are still used in logging and for capturing and training wild elephants. In Asia and Africa elephants are used to transport tourists, and around the world they perform in circuses. The use of elephants for such purposes is controversial.  p 
 p Elephants have also been trained to serve in battle. The most famous historical event using elephants in war was that of  a class="reflink" href=" students article Hannibal 274766" Hannibal  a , the Carthaginian general who crossed the Alps from Spain into Italy in the 3rd century  span class="smallcaps" bc  span . Hannibal left Spain with 37 elephants—36 African forest elephants and one Asian. The Asian, Hannibal’s personal elephant, was the only one that survived to reach Italy.  p 
 p Elephant worship plays a part in several Asian religions.  a class="reflink" href=" students article Hinduism 274887" Hinduism  a , the dominant religion of India, has an elephant-headed god named Ganesa (or Ganesha), who is considered to be the remover of obstacles. He is also the patron of literature and learning. His name, traditionally, has been the first to be called out at the start of worship or at the beginning of a new enterprise. In parts of India elephants are used in religious processions. The white elephant, an albino variety, is particularly sacred in  a class="reflink" href=" students article Buddhism 273390" Buddhism  a . In Thailand the white elephant is a royal symbol. For many years it was pictured on Thailand’s national flag.  p

Elephants are protected by law in most regions of the world where they are found today. However, between 1980 and 1990 Africa’s elephant population fell from about 1.2 million to about 625,000, largely because of poachers hunting elephants for their ivory. A worldwide ban on the ivory trade went into effect in 1989, but illegal trade continued to flourish. Another major threat is habitat loss due to encroachment by humans. Mining, forestry, road development, and other human activities have reduced and fragmented elephant habitats. Elephants are abundant in some parts of Southern Africa, but their survival in Eastern Africa is threatened.  p 
 p The population of Asian elephants is much smaller than that of the African species, with fewer than 50,000 remaining in the wild in the early 21st century. In addition to poaching and habitat loss, wild Asian elephants face conflict with farmers, who sometimes kill elephants that raid crops. Illegal capture for use as work animals or for tourism is another threat to the survival of Asian elephants.  p
