 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" This is very important  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" I love the “fuck it” moment where baby Ellie just submerges it’s entire mouth. So adorable.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Why do i get the feeling that’s something older elephants accept because he’s just a smolboi, but then they will have to encourage him to learn the trunk method or he’ll make a fool of himself once he’s too tall to drink like this safely  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Agreed! And it a an actual safety issue, and elephants can’t typically find deep pools in the wild. That’s the point of the trunks. They have to be able to smell out water, find water, and dig for water. Baby Ellie just went the easy route!!!!  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" The easy route, it’s like potty training! Only for the intake, instead of the opposite  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" He’ll make a fool of himself when a crocodile has his face  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" I love the sneaky eyes when baby thinks “Fuck it...” and just goes for it. Hoping mama didn’t notice to smack his lil bum with her trunk.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" That little leg lift  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" DO NOT bite your trunk.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" instructions unclear: chomped trunk  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" ow  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Oof  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Reminds me of when I'm trying to use chopsticks and get frustrated and whip out my fork.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Reminds me of when I'm trying to use a fork and get frustrated and just go face first into the plate.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Me attempting to use chopsticks  em class="s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq" shoves face in rice  em   p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" This is the best thing I have ever seen. He has the elephant equivalent of a milk mustache. He just dunked his face when he couldn't figure it out. He's amazing. I would kill or die for him.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Who hasn't had one of days were you take the top and straw off the cup to really get a good chug on.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Omg, the little flat ears.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" You can almost see the thought process.  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" "I know this way is more polite, but... " * em class="s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq" Shoves face in water  em *  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Those eyes look like it's naptime after some water in the belly!  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Looks like that young fella has a drinking problem. LOL!  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Me irl when I get home trashed  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Do I chew the water? Like this?  p 
 p class="s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp" Love that sploosh  p
