Standing at a staggering  strong 10 ft   strong and weighing over strong  4 tons  strong  the elephant might be perceived by  few to be a clumsy lumbering and bulky giant but surprisingly  in spite of its incredible size, the elephant is capable of maintaining perfect balance, tread silently and travel thousands of miles in a year.  p

 p Elephants have the  strong longest gestation period  strong  of all the mammals which is an overwhelming  strong 22 months.   strong Since they have a very long pregnancy period , elephants definitely cannot spend that amount of energy and food so often  to give birth very frequently.  p 
 p Thus, every female elephant takes care of their newborns very well  to ensure their survival.  Aside from that, they also adopt orphaned calves and thereby reduce the need to give birth more than once in four years.  p 
 p    p 
 p Amazingly at birth, Newborns are able to stand up in about 2 hours after birth and weighing around 91 kg. They can neck down almost  strong 14 liters of milk  strong  every day.  p 
 p The male adult elephants usually roam separately from the females and they form their own all male social group.  p 
 p    p 
 p The average lifespan of an  strong Asian elephant is 50 years   strong while the  strong African elephant is about 70 years.   strong The oldest elephant that was ever recorded is surprisingly 82 years old.  p 
 p The trunk, tusks and the ear flaps are the most distinct parts of an elephant. Elephants have evolved over time to have a pair of king size flaps as ears and a water hose for a nose. Also they are armed with two ivory knives like tusks which are enough to make every predator to think twice.  p

 p The  strong trunk of an elephant is about 7-8 ft in length about 150 kg in weight   strong and consists of about  strong 100000 muscles   strong making it the most multi-talented organ that an elephant has.  p 
 p An elephant can lift about strong  400 kg  strong  with its trunk, use it like a snorkel while going under water, spray water and mud all over its body , They used mud as a sunscreen, protecting their body to too much heat, They also use their trunk for  feeding themselves.  p 
 p The  strong size of the tusk varies from 1.5-1.8 m for males  strong  and  strong .05-1 m for females  strong . The tusks are modified incisors useful for making territories, self defense and of course for fighting and threatening.  strong The tusks weigh about 50 kg for males and 20 kg for females  strong . br 
Apart from the tusks, the elephant has  strong 24 teeth w  strong hich serve their real purpose of chewing. The chewing teeth include 1 strong 2 molars and 12 premolars.  strong  br 
 strong An elephant’s ear is about 1 6th of it body size in length and just 0.05 inches thick  strong . The ears provide spatial awareness to the elephant. Also they used it as air flaps for cooling down the elephant’s body.  Having large ears gives the elephant extraordinary hearing which seems more or less like a recompense for its poor eyesight. br 
The elephants have a very rough and folded skin which allows their body to have an increased surface area and hence attain lower temperature. br 
Elephants have a pair of beady eyes that contains large eyelashes for protection. Elephants can only see up to strong  20 meters.   strong Hence, they greatly rely on their other senses.  p 
 p An elephant’s  strong brain  strong  is approximately  strong 5 kg in weight   strong and is amongst the biggest brain on the planet . An elephant has a well developed cerebrum and cerebellum allowing it to have a great memory and also experience various emotions. Elephants are amongst the only animals apart from primates to be able to feel complex emotions like grievance for a dead member of the herd and the feeling of compassion towards orphaned calves. br 
An elephant’s  strong heart   strong weighs at about strong  20 kg   strong and has a rather circular structure.the secret of the elephants long life line is its extremely low heart ranging between  strong 25-30 beats per minute  strong .  p 
 p The African elephant has a humongous appetite of  strong 300 kg   strong of food a day while the Asian elephants need to eat up to  strong 150 kg   strong of food every day. Most of their diet consists of leaves, grass, bushes,  etc. Tree barks are considered to be the most nutritious food in an elephant’s diet. It provides them with calcium and other essential minerals which assist digestion.  p 
 p Their diet also includes hay,rice,apples,bananas,bamboos , twigs and roots.  p 
 p Apparently these giants creatures ingest several hundreds pounds of vegetation every day that they can find while roaming.  p 
 p The Indian elephants are known to like sugar cane a lot to the point that they cause damages to to get it. They tend to raid and ruin rice paddies which causes conflict between them and farmers. br 
Elephants have an extremely special fondness for various salts which help in their digestion and regulation of body fluids.  They dig up the ground using their tusk to get salt and minerals.  p 
 p In addition to that, elephants also drinks a lot, they need up to 100 liters of water daily. An extremely thirsty elephant can drink up to 150 liters of water in just a matter of 10 minutes.  p 
 p Elephants would in fact be quite some superheroes considering how gifted they are. Apart from having a Swiss Army knife for a nose they also have phenomenal sniffing skills enabling them to locate water from 12 kilometers away. They can also communicate with other herd members 4 kilometers away by using infrasonic sound which they emit by purring like cats and they pick infrasonic pitches through their feet. This way they can transmit short encrypted messages over long distances. They are able to pick up these pitches by using their extra sensitive feet and overactive, extra large ears with large tympanic membranes and ear canals.  p 
 p Elephants have also a padded feet so they can literally walk like ninjas. They also have an enhanced sense of touch especially in the trunk allowing them to sense even the minutest pressures of touches. br 
Apart from these amazing sensory skills, elephants also have unbelievable social skills which are as cool as their sense of smell. Elephants are renowned for having formed strong bonds with all their herd members and mourning their dead just like humans as they are capable of feeling such complex emotions which is a rarity amongst animals. Apart from mourning, elephants also touch the corpse of their comrade which is considered as an act of paying homage. br 
Elephants have also been seen avoiding the areas where their herd members have died, which is considered as an evolutionary trait.  p 
 p At present, there are about strong  700,000 African elephants   strong and  strong 35,000 Asian elephants  strong  alive.  p 
 p At the beginning of the 21st century, there were about 4 million African elephants and about 100,000 Asian elephants. Most of this population is found in the strong  Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Zambia and South Africa  strong  while  the Asian elephants are mostly found in certain parts of  strong India and Sri Lanka.  strong  Only about strong  40%   strong of the total elephant population is under formally protected areas.  p 
 p Prior to the  strong 80’s  strong , the numbers of elephants is about twice the land. The main reason for the decrease of elephant’s population is  strong poaching  strong  for their  ivory while  strong loss of habitat  strong  is considered to be the second most critical reason for the decline in elephant population.  p 
 p Some envisioned that climate change can also be a threat to their existence. Today, there are continues efforts made by many conservancies to save the existing species of elephant.  p
