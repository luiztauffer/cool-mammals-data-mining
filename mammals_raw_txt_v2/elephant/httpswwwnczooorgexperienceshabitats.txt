 p The Red River Hog habitat is closed for renovations until mid-March.  p 
 p North America’s Streamside exhibit is currently undergoing a renovation.  The building is accessible during renovation but some of the animals may not be visible.   p 
 p More than 1,800 animals call the North Carolina Zoo home. The animals live in habitats representing two regions—Africa and North America—plus a global Desert and a tropical, free-flight Aviary. As the world's largest natural habitat zoo, the animals at the North Carolina Zoo have plenty of room to roam.   p 
 p The Zoo is thrilled to announce that a new region, Asia, is in development and is scheduled to open for the 2023 season. Asia is expected to include, among other animals, tigers, red pandas and Komodo dragons!  p 
 p The year 1994 was memorable at the Zoo as it’s when the North America region opened and when three polar bear siblings arrived, creating a statewide buzz. Nikita and Anana are our current polar bear stars and are joined by black bears, grizzly bears, red wolves and hundreds of other animals in this diverse region.  p 
 p Ground was first broken for the Africa region in the spring of 1976, and the grand opening of the original five habitats took place in the summer of 1980. Today, it’s home to a multitude of habitats, including those showcasing chimpanzees, giraffes, gorillas, zebras and, of course, elephants.  p 
 p More than 100 exotic birds—representing 36 species—and more than 3,000 gorgeous tropical plants live and thrive in our walk-through aviary.  p
