 p That’s one small step for an elephant, but a giant leap for the survival of tiny aquatic animals. In the  a href="https:  www.newscientist.com article mg22630215-700-ugandas-forests-dwindle-as-illegal-settlers-hollow-them-out " swamp forests of Kibale National Park, Uganda  a , every step elephants take can give rise to a footprint-shaped mini-pond. They can hold substantial amounts of water – 200 litres, in the case of one formed of two merged footprints – and  a href="https:  www.newscientist.com article dn27161-icy-pools-are-oases-for-unique-glacier-ecosystems " dozens of invertebrate species  a .  p 
 p “I was surprised to find out that these footprints were water-filled all year round, and that they harboured such a high diversity,” says Wolfram Remmers at the University of Koblenz in Germany. Surveying 30 such prints over a three-day period in 2014, Remmers and his colleagues found over 60 species, including beetles, spiders and worms – plus tadpoles.  p 
 p Many smaller species may live there, too – the team’s sampling method meant they only caught things bigger than 2 millimetres.

 p The footprints probably play an important role in allowing these small life forms to spread, as they form a network of connected ponds.  p 
 p “We assume that [the animals] do ‘pond-hop’, especially since many of them can fly,” says Remmers. “The elephant footprints act as ‘stepping-stone-habitats’.”  p 
 p This makes the presence of elephants unexpectedly important for tiny aquatic species.  p 
 p “If the elephants disappear those habitats would vanish,” says Remmers. “It is likely that some species – such as some dragonflies – would have a very hard time finding suitable breeding habitats.” Some aquatic species might disappear locally, he adds.  p 
 p The findings help us understand how  a href="https:  www.newscientist.com article mg22129580-700-rewilding-bring-in-the-big-beasts-to-fix-ecosystems " large herbivores influence their habitat  a , says Gary Haynes at the University of Nevada, Reno. We already had an inkling of that, because of the way elephants remove trees and create gaps in forests – sometimes even encouraging the formation of grasslands. Their dung is also an important fertiliser.  p 
 p But evidently they have an impact on the microscopic scale too. “Modern-day elephants and other mega-herbivores shape [their habitats] in ways we are just beginning to fully appreciate,” says Haynes.  p
