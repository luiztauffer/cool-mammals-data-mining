 p The persistence of wide-ranging mammals such as Asian elephants in fragmented landscapes requires extending conservation efforts into human-dominated landscapes around protected areas. Understanding how elephants use such landscapes may help facilitate their movements and reduce conflict incidence. We studied elephants' use of fragmented habitats and ranging patterns of focal herds in a landscape of rainforest fragments embedded in tea, coffee, and  i Eucalyptus  i  plantations in the Anamalai Hills. Elephant herds entering this landscape were tracked daily between April 2002 and March 2006, resulting in 985 GPS locations of herds obtained across six major habitats. Natural vegetation in rainforest fragments and riparian habitats, despite low coverage in the landscape, was preferred by elephants during the day. At night, elephants preferred riparian vegetation, avoided other habitats such as swamps and settlements, while the remaining habitats were used proportional to availability. Use of rainforest fragments and riparian vegetation increased over three years of study with a corresponding decline in the use of tea monoculture. Among plantation habitats, coffee, and  i Eucalyptus  i  were used significantly more during wet and dry seasons, respectively. The concentration of elephants along a major riparian system in the center of the landscape emphasized the role of water and food availability in habitat use during the dry season. Protection of rainforest fragments, secondary vegetation along rivers, and regulated and sequential felling (instead of clear-felling) of  i Eucalyptus  i  along elephant movement routes will help retain forage, cover, and passage routes of elephant herds and may reduce direct human-elephant encounters in such fragmented landscapes.  p

 p In order to examine patterns of elephant habitat use, we stratified the Valparai plateau into six broad habitat types, which included three plantation types (tea, coffee, and  i Eucalyptus  i ), rainforest fragments, riparian vegetation, and others (mainly swamps and settlements). The study was designed to examine elephant habitat use by recording (comparing) frequencies of elephant locations in each habitat through systematic records of elephant locations from direct observations and herd tracking. Radio-collaring of elephants was not possible during this study; however, field conditions of visibility, access into plantations, and a network of estate roads and informants enabled locating all herds that came into plantations on a daily basis and tracking them to obtain regular locations along movement paths. Since the location data represented continuous and systematic sampling, as in the case of radio-collaring, it can be usefully applied for assessing habitat preference (by comparison with proportion of area available under each habitat in the landscape), and temporal (diurnal and seasonal) variation [ a data-rid="bibr21-194008291000300203" data-reflink="_i21" data-referenceslink="[21] Harris G.

 p Direct sightings, fresh signs such as dung, and information from local informants were used to locate elephants within the plantation landscape. Once an elephant herd was located, it was followed for recording its location and habitat parameters such as habitat type, distance of nearest forest fragment, distance of nearest human settlement, etc., on each subsequent day until the herd moved out of the private plantations into the surrounding protected areas. Night-time movement of elephants was tracked using fresh signs of dung, footprints, and feeding signs to the location where elephants were seen on the previous day. Daytime locations and nighttime tracking locations (at 500 m intervals on the tracked route) were recorded using a Global Positioning System (GPS, Garmin 12 XL) handset.

 p In the plantation-forest mosaic of the Valparai plateau, elephants used rainforest fragments and vegetation along rivers more than areas under plantation crops when considered relative to availability ( span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-fig6-194008291000300203"  a title="Open Figure Viewer" href="#" class="showFiguresEEvent figure-no-fig6-194008291000300203" data-attr-fig-id="fig6-194008291000300203" Fig. 6 span class="overlay"   span   a   span ). This indicates the importance of natural vegetation for elephants in such plantation landscapes. Some degraded rainforest fragments on the plateau contained secondary vegetation providing favorable habitat and forage for elephants. The presence of reeds ( i Ochlandra  i ) along streams and in forest fragments also encouraged elephants' use of natural habitats [ a data-rid="bibr40-194008291000300203" data-reflink="_i21" data-referenceslink="[40] Kumar M.

Among plantation crops, coffee and  i Eucalyptus  i  seemed to be more important habitats than tea in areas devoid of natural vegetation. Availability of tree canopy along with secondary vegetation and grass growth in plantations of coffee and  i Eucalyptus  i  appeared to provide cover and fodder for elephants. Moreover, as coffee is a seasonal fruit crop and  i Eucalyptus  i  plantations are felled for fuel only once in seven years, elephants may use these areas more due to the lower human activity, unlike in tea plantations that witness more intensive, year-round tea-leaf harvest and agricultural operations. Thus, coffee and  i Eucalyptus  i  plantations act as important habitats in the plantation landscape of the Valparai plateau.  p

 p Elephant usage of habitat was also influenced by the time of the day, with natural vegetation areas being preferred by day and greater usage of tea plantations at night. This pattern may be attributed to greater time spent on feeding and other activities in areas which provide fodder and cover during the day, while tea plantation was mainly used for movement between foraging areas at night. Tea, a non-palatable crop, involves intensive human activity during the day and the elephants' low preference during the day may be a form of risk-avoidance behavior with movements through such open habitats more likely at night [ a data-rid="bibr29-194008291000300203" data-reflink="_i21" data-referenceslink="[29] Graham M.

 p Across years, an increased use of natural vegetation with a gradual decrease in the use of tea plantations by elephants was recorded.

Higher rainfall in the subsequent years of Year 2 (2004–05, 316 cm) and Year 3 (2005–06, 436 cm), comparable to the long-term annual rainfall average of 350 cm for the region, resulted in increased use of natural vegetation and decreased use of tea plantations by elephants.

On the Valparai plateau, elephants used coffee plantations more in the dry season and  i Eucalyptus  i  plantations more during the wet season. Coffee plantations are used more frequently by elephants during the dry season, possibly due to the presence of grass under tree cover and browse from native shade trees. Moreover, as most of the coffee picking is restricted to three months (November – January) in a year, elephant use of coffee plantation corresponds to a period of minimal human activity during most of the dry season. Natural vegetation was important in both seasons for elephants. The retention of natural vegetation in forest fragments and riparian vegetation is important because the protein component in the browse in these habitats is significant in the diet of elephants [ a data-rid="bibr50-194008291000300203" data-reflink="_i21" data-referenceslink="[50] Sukumar R. and Ramesh R. 1995.

Further degradation of rainforest fragments will lead to proliferation of weeds such as  i Lantana camara  i  and  i Chromolaena odorata  i  that suppress the growth of native plants, thereby reducing food resources for elephants. There are no quantitative data, however, on resource availability and seasonal variability in modified habitats such as plantations. Future studies that directly measure availability of water and resources such as forage and cover would be necessary to ascertain which of these resources are most influential in elephant use of natural and man-modified habitats ( span class="figure refFigure figuresContent" id="ref-fig7-194008291000300203"  a title="Open Figure Viewer" href="#" class="showFiguresEEvent figure-no-fig7-194008291000300203" data-attr-fig-id="fig7-194008291000300203" Fig. 7 span class="overlay"   span   a   span ).  p

 p At the larger landscape level, the ranging pattern of elephants clearly indicates that substantial areas are used outside the designated protected areas. Although these herds ranged over a large part of the plateau, this includes only a part of their home range as these herds were noticed moving into surrounding protected areas. Consistent movements over certain non-overlapping areas by the two focal herds indicate fidelity to home ranges, which has been noticed in other studies [ a data-rid="bibr51-194008291000300203" data-reflink="_i21" data-referenceslink="[51] Fernando P., Wikramanayake E.

 p Humans and elephants have lived in close proximity to each other over centuries and they appear to coexist in altered landscapes. The Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species under Schedule I of Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972, which enables high protection for elephants under Indian law. Patchy distribution of rainforest fragments and riparian vegetation on the plateau would benefit from wide-ranging species such as elephants as they act as seed dispersal agents in regeneration of natural vegetation. An icon of Indian society, the Asian elephant has been integral to cultural and religious festivals of people in India. The Valparai plateau with its 100,000 people living in plantations celebrates the elephant presence in festivals indicating their positive attitude towards pachyderms in this region.  p

 p Improved management, wildlife enforcement, and awareness programs would facilitate unhindered movement of elephants across plantations and promote human-elephant coexistence in the Valparai region. In highly fragmented landscapes, such as the Valparai plateau, forest fragments and riparian vegetation play important roles in the ecology of elephants. Conserving these patches and protecting them from further degradation is crucial for conservation of elephants as they are highly dependent on natural vegetation despite its patchy distribution. Retention and restoration of natural vegetation along rivers would develop connectivity between forest fragments for elephants. Such a step would facilitate easy passage of elephants and help decrease human-elephant direct encounters [ a data-rid="bibr40-194008291000300203" data-reflink="_i21" data-referenceslink="[40] Kumar M.

Preventing conversion of plantation habitats such as coffee with shade tree cover to tea plantations would help retain food and cover resources and facilitate elephant movement between forest fragments. Sequential or regulated felling and strict imposition of “no logging zone” of  i Eucalyptus  i  at least 20 m on either side of rivers will act as shelter belts for elephants during their movement and will help reduce human-elephant conflicts.  p
