However, the benefits gained from sociality may change as the habitat becomes familiar. Furthermore, the particular individuals with whom animals associate upon arrival at a new place, familiar conspecifics or knowledgeable unfamiliar residents, may influence the type of information they acquire about their new home. To examine animals' social dynamics in novel habitats, we studied the social behaviour of African elephants ( i Loxodonta africana  i ) translocated into a novel environment. We found that the translocated elephants' association with conspecifics decreased over time supporting our hypothesis that sociality provides added benefits in novel environments. In addition, we found a positive correlation between body condition and social association, suggesting that elephants gain direct benefits from sociality. Furthermore, the translocated elephants associated significantly less than expected with the local residents and more than expected with familiar, but not necessarily genetically related, translocated elephants. The social segregation between the translocated and resident elephants declined over time, suggesting that elephants can integrate into an existing social setting. Knowledge of the relationship between sociality and habitat familiarity is highly important in our constantly changing world to both conservation practice and our understanding of animals' behaviour in novel environments.  p

Dispersing individuals encounter novel habitats while searching for a place in which to settle ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib44" id="bib44R" class="tab-link" Stenseth &amp; Lidicker 1992  a ), and migrating animals locate novel habitats periodically ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib32" id="bib32R" class="tab-link" Mettke-Hofmann &amp; Gwinner 2004  a ). Furthermore, animals encounter novel places owing to human modifications to the environment, e.g. habitat loss ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib45" id="bib45R" class="tab-link" Sutherland &amp; Dolman 1994  a ), and fragmentation ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib13" id="bib13R" class="tab-link" Ewers &amp; Didham 2006  a ), or owing to wildlife management activities such as translocations and reintroductions ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib19" id="bib19R" class="tab-link" Griffith  i et al.  i  1989  a ;  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib14" id="bib14R" class="tab-link" Fischer &amp; Lindenmayer 2000  a ). In both natural and unnatural encounters with novel habitats, animals lack vital information regarding suitable forage, hiding locations, mating opportunities and predators. Social interactions with conspecifics can expedite animals' acclimation to a novel environment.  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" Despite the extensive work on the adaptive significance of sociality ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib38" id="bib38R" class="tab-link" Slobodchikoff 1988  a ), very little is known about its importance when animals face novel environments. Several benefits may be gained from interacting with conspecifics in a novel habitat. For example, social learning and cueing are important mechanisms for rapidly gaining knowledge about a new environment (see reviews in  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib10" id="bib10R" class="tab-link" Danchin  i et al.  i  (2004)  a  and  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib4" id="bib4R" class="tab-link" Bonnie &amp; Earley (2007)  a ) and the presence of conspecifics is known to facilitate learning novel tasks ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib33" id="bib33R" class="tab-link" Moscovice &amp; Snowdon 2006  a ). Associating with conspecifics in a novel environment may provide protection against unknown predators ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib21" id="bib21R" class="tab-link" Isbell  i et al.  i  1990  a ) and unfamiliar aggressive conspecifics ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib7" id="bib7R" class="tab-link" Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1983  a ;  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib22" id="bib22R" class="tab-link" Jack &amp; Fedigan 2004  a ). However, associating with conspecifics in a novel environment can also entail costs owing to resource competition ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib25" id="bib25R" class="tab-link" Koenig 2002  a ) and agonistic interactions during territory acquisition ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib41" id="bib41R" class="tab-link" Stamps 1994  a ).  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" We suggest two hypotheses regarding the relationship between sociality and animals' familiarity with a habitat. Our first hypothesis ‘beneficial sociality in novel environments’ (BSNE) states that animals gain added benefits from associating with conspecifics in a novel environment (e.g. through social learning), but these added benefits diminish as the habitat becomes familiar. BSNE predicts a decrease in the number of conspecifics an animal associates with over time. Our alternative hypothesis, ‘costly sociality in novel environments’ (CSNE) states that social associations in a novel habitat incur added costs (e.g. owing to territorial disputes), but these costs are outweighed by the benefits of sociality as the habitat becomes familiar. CSNE predicts an increase in the number of conspecifics an animal associates with over time. To our knowledge, no study has thus far investigated this relationship between sociality and habitat familiarity.  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" Another important question about animal sociality in novel environments is as follows: who are the particular individuals that animals associate with? Animals can associate with either unfamiliar local residents or familiar conspecifics that arrived with them to the new location. Associating with familiar conspecifics has several advantages, including protection during encounters with aggressive unfamiliar conspecifics ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib7" id="bib7R" class="tab-link" Cheney &amp; Seyfarth 1983  a ;  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib22" id="bib22R" class="tab-link" Jack &amp; Fedigan 2004  a ), inclusive fitness benefits ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib46" id="bib46R" class="tab-link" Ward &amp; Hart 2003  a ) and reducing neophobia ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib9" id="bib9R" class="tab-link" Coleman &amp; Mellgren 1994  a ). Furthermore, associating with unfamiliar conspecifics can be costly. For example, unfamiliar individuals may carry unknown diseases ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib28" id="bib28R" class="tab-link" Loehle 1995  a ) or be aggressive ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib18" id="bib18R" class="tab-link" Goossens  i et al.  i  2005  a ), and learning about unfamiliar conspecifics may come at the expense of learning about the new habitat ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib5" id="bib5R" class="tab-link" Burman &amp; Mendl 1999  a ). However, in a novel setting, there is an asymmetry in the knowledge about the new habitat: the local, unfamiliar residents have information about the new habitat that familiar conspecifics might not have ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib16" id="bib16R" class="tab-link" Forsman  i et al.  i  2007  a ). Thus, there may be a great advantage to associating with unfamiliar residents in a novel environment.  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" African elephants' ( i Loxodonta africana  i ) social dynamics provide an excellent opportunity for studying sociality in novel environments. Elephants live in fission–fusion societies in which core family groups (second tier units) occasionally form bond groups (third tier social structures) ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib35" id="bib35R" class="tab-link" Moss &amp; Poole 1983  a ;  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib50" id="bib50R" class="tab-link" Wittemyer  i et al.  i  2005  a ). Elephants' social dynamics are governed by ecological factors ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib50" id="bib50R" class="tab-link" Wittemyer  i et al.  i  2005  a ) and the formation of bond groups is thought to be important for gathering both social ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib35" id="bib35R" class="tab-link" Moss &amp; Poole 1983  a ) and ecological ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib15" id="bib15R" class="tab-link" Foley 2002  a ) information. Furthermore, elephants are highly intelligent mammals ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib20" id="bib20R" class="tab-link" Hart  i et al.  i  2008  a ) that are capable of distinguishing between the vocal signatures of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics (McComb  i et al.  i  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib29" id="bib29R" class="tab-link" 2000  a ,  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib31" id="bib31R" class="tab-link" 2003  a ).  p

First, to distinguish between our BSNE and CSNE hypotheses, we examined the change over time in association between the translocated elephants and conspecifics (familiar and unfamiliar). Based on the African elephants' social learning abilities and their lack of territorial behaviour, we predicted to find evidence supporting the BSNE hypothesis. Second, we examined whether the translocated elephants formed bond groups with familiar or unfamiliar conspecifics, predicting that they will associate with knowledgeable unfamiliar conspecifics to learn about their new home. Finally, we explored possible explanations for the social patterns found.  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" During September 2005, 150 African elephants were translocated from Shimba Hills National Reserve on the coast of Kenya (4.0° S to 4.3° S and 39.5° E to 39.3° E) to Tsavo East National Park (2.0° S to 3.7° S and 38.1° E to 39.3° E), a distance of 160 km. This translocation was part of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) effort to decrease human–elephant conflict in the vicinity of Shimba Hills. Twenty elephant groups comprising adult females, juveniles and calves (average group size 6.8) and 20 independent adult males were moved over the course of 32 days. The release site differs ecologically from the source site and is separated from it by dense human population, providing a unique opportunity for examining the social behaviour of the elephants in a novel environment.  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" During the translocation, all the elephants were tagged with yellow zip ties on their tails to distinguish them from the local Tsavo elephant population. Unique white numbers painted on the translocated elephants' backs, natural ear marks and tusk shapes were used for individual identification of the translocated elephants ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib34" id="bib34R" class="tab-link" Moss 1996  a ). Elephants' ages were estimated based on  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib34" id="bib34R" class="tab-link" Moss (1996)  a .  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" The locations, their time and the identities of the translocated and local Tsavo elephants were recorded in Tsavo East for a year post-translocation using a Geko 201 GPS unit (Garmin Ltd., USA). Road transects were conducted using a vehicle four to five times a week, alternating between four routes of similar length (50–70 km) on the existing roads within Tsavo East National Park. A total of 3371 elephant sightings were recorded, of which 386 and 2985 were the translocated and local elephants, respectively. Of the 150 elephants translocated, data on 83 were obtained, and are presented here. Because males leave the social unit in which they were born at the age of 15, and because the social behaviour of these independent males differs from that of females and their young offspring ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib35" id="bib35R" class="tab-link" Moss &amp; Poole 1983  a ), such translocated males were excluded from our analyses.  p

They showed that elephants can individually recognize conspecifics' vocalizations over great distances (1 km). Therefore, the definition of social association used here includes not only direct interactions but also recognizes the communicative capabilities of elephants to acquire information about the number and identities (translocated or local) of vocalizing conspecifics (McComb  i et al.  i  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib29" id="bib29R" class="tab-link" 2000  a ,  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib31" id="bib31R" class="tab-link" 2003  a ). Thus, the definition of social association used here allows for the acquisition of inadvertent social information about the new environment ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib10" id="bib10R" class="tab-link" Danchin  i et al.  i  2004  a ).  p

Time was a fixed effect in the model, elephant identity was included as a random effect to control for repeated measures of the same translocated individual and season (wet or dry) was included as a fixed effect in the model to account for the seasonal effects on social association.  p

The social association between the translocated elephants and conspecifics (both the locals and translocated) decreased over time. This result supports our BSNE hypothesis, which states that animals gain added benefits from associating with conspecifics when arriving at a novel environment, but these added benefits diminish as the habitat becomes familiar. We found more social associations in the wet than the dry seasons, coinciding with the social behaviour of undisturbed elephant populations in which resource competition may drive this trend ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib27" id="bib27R" class="tab-link" Leuthold 1976  a ;  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib50" id="bib50R" class="tab-link" Wittemyer  i et al.  i  2005  a ). Our finding that body condition positively correlated with the number of individuals a translocated elephant associated with implies that elephants indeed gain direct benefits from sociality. However, this does not exclude elephants in poor body condition having few social associations for other reasons (e.g. being sick or wounded). The relationship we found between sociality and habitat familiarity for elephants was expected based on their reliance on social knowledge for gaining information about their habitat ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib15" id="bib15R" class="tab-link" Foley 2002  a ). However, it is possible that in other species (e.g. territorial animals), a different relationship between sociality and habitat familiarity will be found.  p

It is safe to assume that association among the translocated elephants post-release reflected social bonds among familiar individuals when considering elephants' extraordinary social memory ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib30" id="bib30R" class="tab-link" McComb  i et al.  i  2001  a ;  a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib20" id="bib20R" class="tab-link" Hart  i et al.  i  2008  a ), long-distance communication abilities ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib31" id="bib31R" class="tab-link" McComb  i et al.  i  2003  a ), the small site from which the elephants were translocated (250 km sup xmlns:contenttype="java:com.atypon.literatum.acs.content.ContentType" 2  sup ) and their ranging patterns there ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib24" id="bib24R" class="tab-link" Kahumbu 2002  a ). Animals that rely on social learning and are not territorial may benefit from associating with local unfamiliar knowledgeable conspecifics. Newly released translocated primates often integrate into the local resident groups ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib18" id="bib18R" class="tab-link" Goossens  i et al.  i  2005  a ) and conspecific cueing is successfully used for manipulating colonial birds into settling novel habitats ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib23" id="bib23R" class="tab-link" Jeffries &amp; Brunton 2001  a ). However, accounts of translocated birds avoiding established residents exist ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib8" id="bib8R" class="tab-link" Clarke &amp; Schedvin 1997  a ), shoaling fish preferentially interact with familiar conspecifics in novel environments ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib46" id="bib46R" class="tab-link" Ward &amp; Hart 2003  a ) and humans are known to form immigrant enclaves upon arrival at a new country ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#bib48" id="bib48R" class="tab-link" Wierzbicki 2004  a ).  p

Forming bond groups with familiar conspecifics did not provide inclusive fitness benefits to the translocated elephants. The genetic relatedness among elephants captured in separate family units was low, and no correlation was detected between this low genetic relatedness and their social association. However, the fact that the social segregation did not persist throughout our study suggests that habitat familiarity or familiarity with the local population may have influenced bond group formation. The costs of associating with unfamiliar conspecifics (both to the translocated and local elephants) could have initially outweighed any potential benefits. Indeed, on the two observations of direct interactions between the translocated and local groups (which occurred within a month from the translocated elephants' release), the locals exhibited aggressive behaviour towards the translocated elephants.  p

Animals' ability to sustain social bonds when moved into a novel habitat and later assimilate socially into an existing population, as seen here, can provide important insights for wildlife management actions, enhance our understanding of animals' response to human-induced environmental changes and augment behavioural studies of animals' natural life stages such as dispersal and migration. As the world continues to change, understanding animals' behavioural dynamics in relation to habitat changes will be increasingly important for developing conservation tools and enhancing our basic understanding of animals' acclimation to novel environments.  p
