 p PHUKET’S FIRST ETHICAL ELEPHANT SANCTUARY  p 
 p 
            Bordering the Khao Phra Thaeo National Park, the  b Phuket Elephant Sanctuary  b  offers a new home for overtired elephants who have suffered from working long hours in the logging and tourism industry. As the first ethical elephant tourism experience in Phuket, we rescue sick, injured and old elephants, welcoming them back into their indigenous habit.
            p 
 p At  b Phuket Elephant Sanctuary  b  elephants can just be elephants. Feed them pineapples and bananas, and observe these gentle giants as they enjoy their newfound freedom, socialize with each other and bathe freely in our expansive fresh water lagoons.

 p  b Your visit guarantees to leave you inspired, transformed and in awe of these majestic animals.  b   p

              Elephants love to swim, cool off and splash in the water, and to cover themselves with thick mud. They like to do so alone or with fellow elephants. However, if people crowd around or interact with them during this bathing ritual, it becomes stressful for the elephants, preventing them from enjoying their time in the water and displaying their natural behavior.
              p 
 p To give the elephants the privacy they need and to enjoy their day as much as you, we built an Observation Sala overlooking our fresh water pond, from where you can witness the elephants enjoying their bathing time alone or with other elephants. This is a great photo opportunity and educational experience as you can observe the elephants behave naturally.
            p 
 p We do offer a brief interaction between visitors and our elephants during a feeding moment as part of the tour. This is a rare opportunity to get up close with the elephants and to capture some incredible photographs as they enjoy a few watermelons, pineapples, bananas or cucumbers.  p
