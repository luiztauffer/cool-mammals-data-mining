 p African elephants inhabit a diverse array of habitats  including tropical forests, savannas, grasslands, and woodlands.  p 
 p 
  Tropical forests are characterized as having little variance  in temperature (around 23°C) and length of daylight (around 12 hours). However,  rainfall varies considerably in the tropics and is a primary factor as to the  type of vegetation that grows in an area.  p 
 p 
  Savannas are characterized as grasslands with widely  scattered trees. They generally have distinct dry and rainy seasons.  p 
 p Grasslands are characterized as having cold winter  temperatures. Seasonal droughts, occasional fires, and grazing by large mammals  prevent woody shrubs and trees from becoming established. Grassland soil is  very nutrient rich and perennial grass roots are often deeply embedded.  p 
 p 
  Woodlands are characterized as an area covered with trees  and shrubs. Woodlands differ from forests by having a large, open canopy with  sunlight filtering between treetops. Forests have a largely—closed canopy in  which sunlight does not readily filter through the treetops and almost  continuous shade is provided.  p 
 p 
  Asian elephants primarily inhabit tropical forest habitats.  p 
 p Both Asian and African elephants migrate and generally  follow the same migratory routes annually. Migration distances vary  considerably depending on environmental conditions. During a prolonged dry  season in Africa, elephant migration distances were recorded to extend over 100  km (62 mi.). Studies documenting Asian elephants in deciduous forests of  southern India, with numerous water sources, reported elephant migration to  extend between 20 and 50 km (12 and 31 mi.).  p 
 p 
  African elephants usually migrate at the beginning of the  dry season, between June and November; heading toward more hospitable locations  near rivers and water sources that are not prone to drying. When the rainy  season arrives, usually from October to December and March to June, elephant  herds return to native regions to feed on the lush, green vegetation the rains  helped regenerate. Elephant migration allows time for the re—growth of  vegetation in exhausted grazing areas.  p 
 p 
  Elephant migrations occur in one of the following three  ways. The migration method depends on environmental conditions.  p 
 p African elephants are estimated to have a total population  between 400,000 and 660,000 individuals. Individual forest and savanna  populations have not been reported by the IUCN—The World Conservation Union,  pending further genetic and phylogenic research for various hybrid  classifications. The IUCN currently lists the African elephant as threatened.  p 
 p 
  Currently, all Asian elephant subspecies are classified as  endangered by the IUCN, with a total population estimate ranging between 25,600  and 32,750 individuals. The Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is the most numerous  with population estimates ranging between 20,000 and 25,000 individuals. The  Sumatran and Sri Lankan elephants are critically endangered, with populations  estimated to be between 2,440 and 3,350 for the Sumatran elephant and 3,160 and  4,400 for the Sri Lankan elephant. The most endangered of all Asian subspecies  is the Borneo elephant with population estimates ranging from 1,000 to 1,500  individuals.  p
