 p A resurgence of illegal poaching of elephants in  Africa, primarily for their ivory but also for meat and in retaliation for  human-elephant conflict, is resulting in the serious decline of both forest and savanna  elephant populations. Even in some of Africa’s  premiere parks, once thought to be safe havens, elephants are now under attack.  Between 2011 and 2014,  African elephant poaching levels reached the highest level recorded since  international monitors began keeping detailed records in 2002. Across Africa, an  estimated 100,000 elephants were killed for their ivory between 2010 and 2012,  and the continent-wide estimate for all elephants has now been revised downward  to 420,000. Despite some progress in halting and stabilizing the resurgence of elephant poaching since 2011, in some areas, Africa's elephants are still being poached at higher rates than they can naturally reproduce.  p 
 p In addition to the direct threat caused by poaching, the natural habitat  of African elephants is shrinking as human populations grow and forests and  savannas are cleared for infrastructure development, agriculture, and  extractive industries such as logging and mining. Loss and degradation of  habitat leaves elephants with a very limited food supply, which results in high  levels of human-elephant conflict and retaliatory killings when hungry  elephants enter villages and destroy local farmers’ crops.  p

 p The forests of  strong Central Africa  strong  have been particularly hard hit. The total  population of forest elephants declined by 62% between 2002 and 2011.  Researchers estimate that forest elephants have disappeared entirely from 30%  of the area they occupied a decade earlier. These declines have been  particularly devastating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where  warfare, the proliferation of weapons, and trading in ivory to fuel rebel  factions have resulted in the loss of 80% (80,000) of the country's elephants since  1970. Gabon, which is home to more than 50 percent of the world's remaining forest elephants, has also not been spared. Gabon's Minkébé National Park, bordering Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo, was once home to the highest densities of forest elephants in Central Africa. Over a recent ten-year period, approximately 80 percent (more than 25,000) of the elephants in this park were killed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's  a href="https:  www.fws.gov international wildlife-without-borders africa " Africa Regional Program  a  has been working closely with Gabon's National Parks Agency (ANPN) to protect elephants and other wildlife, to strengthen  the capacity of ANPN as a key partner in the region, and to ensure the  political will necessary for long-term success.  p 
 p West Africa has lost most of its elephants, with few populations exceeding 100 animals, and poaching levels remain high. The northernmost Mali desert elephants are at serious risk because of scarce resources, warfare, and rampant poaching in the absence of effective wildlife law enforcement. Local staff and residents had made significant progress to protect the elephants and their water sites but this security has been undermined by recent instability.  p

 p  The future of elephants in  strong East Africa   strong is far from  certain. As recently as 2008, Tanzania was home to the second largest  population of elephants in Africa, with an estimated 110,000-165,000  individuals according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature  (IUCN) African Elephant Species Specialist Group’s African Elephant Database.  However, by Tanzania’s own estimate, the country has lost 60% of its elephants  in the past five years, dropping to a national total of 43,330. Its most  significant population (in the Selous-Mikumi ecosystem) dropped from 70,000 in  2006 to 40,000 by 2009, and to a shocking 13,084 elephants in 2013 – a 66% loss  in just three years. The next two largest populations also experienced  catastrophic declines between 2009 and 2014, Ruaha-Rungwa dropped from 30,000  to 8,000 and Mulagarasi-Moyowosi-Kigosi declined from 15,000 to 3,000.  Since 2015, reports of reduced poaching levels in some parts of East Africa, including Kenya's Tsavo National Park, are encouraging and highlight what can be achieved through sustained and collective front-line efforts and political support.  p 
 p Since the early 1980s,  strong Southern Africa  strong  has been the main  stronghold and safe haven for elephant populations. Through immigration and  natural population growth, Africa’s largest elephant population, in northern Botswana,  grew steadily from 80,000 in 1996 to 129,000 in 2014. But in recent years, Botswana  has also been targeted by poachers, with regular reports of poached carcasses  being found in Chobe and Moremi National Parks and surrounding areas. Recent  estimates show  the elephant population  in Zimbabwe to be more than 80,000 elephants  p
