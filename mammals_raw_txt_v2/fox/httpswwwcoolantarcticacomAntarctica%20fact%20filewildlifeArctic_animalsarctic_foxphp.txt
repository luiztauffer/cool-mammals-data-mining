 p  strong Average Weight:  strong  3 to 8kg (6.5-17 lbs) strong  br 
						 br Average Length:  strong  75 to 110 cm long (2.3-3.5 
						feet) including a tail of around 30cm (12 inches), 20 to 
						30cm (9-12 inches) tall at the shoulder, females slightly 
						smaller than males br  br  strong Breeding Season:  strong  
						Arctic foxes form monogamous pairs through a breeding season 
						(April to May) though often several females will live together 
						in a large and complex den that can be many years old, even 
						centuries. Typically they have litters of 5 to 8 but may 
						be as many as 25, the most of any carnivore. Sometimes young 
						non-breeding foxes will live in the den also and help to 
						raise the pups from the following year. br  br  strong Estimated 
						world population:  strong  - Several hundred thousand, wide 
						fluctuations as a result of varying prey numbers and a rapid 
						ability to reproduce. br  br  strong Feeding &amp; diet:  strong  A 
						wide range of foods, the main prey is lemmings, they will 
						hunt and catch other small animals and will also scavenge 
						food from beneath sea-bird colonies on cliffs and left overs 
						from predators such as polar bears. They will take bird 
						eggs where possible from tundra nesting birds, though are 
						not entirely carnivorous eating berries and seaweed when 
						available. br 
						 br 
						A family of foxes can get through several dozen lemmings 
						in a day. They will eat young ringed seals when they are 
						vulnerable in the snow den shortly after they are born in 
						the same manner that they attack lemmings beneath the snow, 
						detecting them by sound and then jumping on and punching 
						through the covering snow layer. br  br  strong Conservation 
						status:   strong Least Concern. br  br  strong Distribution  strong : 
						The Arctic Fox lives its whole life above the northern tree 
						line in the Arctic tundra, it has found its way to most 
						Arctic islands and is the only mammal native to Iceland. 
						It may be found on the sea-ice in winter as it extends its 
						foraging range. The southern limit of the arctic fox is 
						partially dictated by the presence of red foxes which out-compete 
						arctic foxes in areas where tundra turns to shrubs and trees. br 
						 br  strong Predators:  strong  Polar bears, wolverines, 
						red foxes and golden eagles. They have been and continue 
						to be trapped for their thick winter coats in particular.  p
