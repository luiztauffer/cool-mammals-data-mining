                                Foxes were introduced to Australia in the
                                mid-1800s for hunting and in about 100 years
                                spread to most of the continent. Recently,
                                foxes have also been introduced into Tasmania
                                but efforts are already underway to eliminate
                                foxes from this island. The map of fox

                                Foxes have had a major impact on the Australian
                                fauna, predating on ground nesting birds,
                                mammals and reptiles. Moreover foxes compete
                                with Australian native animals for food and
                                habitat and can act as a reservoir of disease
                                for wildlife and domestic animals.

                                Introduced foxes in Australia act as biological
                                control agents, limiting the populations of
                                many Australian mammals (7 mammals are
                                threatened and a further 14 are perceived to be
                                threatened). Smaller marsupials such as
                                 strong wallabies, possums and rat
                                kangaroos  strong  in particular have suffered
                                population declines due to fox predation.
                                However, the decline of Australian mammals is
                                due to a complex series of interacting factors.
                                A recent study found that marsupials have
                                survived best where  strong dingoes  strong 
                                (Australian wild dogs) are found at high
                                densities. However, after they introduced
                                sheep, the European settlers persecuted dingoes
                                throughout the continent, leading to their
                                extinction in many parts of south and east
                                Australia. Dingoes kill the smaller foxes and
                                cats, and so where dingo numbers are high, fox
                                and cat numbers are low. Thus persecution of
                                dingoes led to an increase in fox and cat
                                numbers, and increased predation pressure on a
                                number of marsupials.

                                A study on urban foxes in Melbourne found that,
                                contrary to what happens in the UK where foxes
                                use other animals' borrows, foxes dug most
                                of the dens they lived in. When denning beneath
                                building, most foxes (75%) chose those occupied
                                by a single person or where persons were not
                                living on a permanent basis, indicating that
                                they preferred areas with low human
                                disturbance. As found previously in Britain,
                                foxes preferred buildings without domestic
                                dogs. Foxes selected areas infested with exotic
                                weeds (fennel, blackberry and African thistle)
                                as shelter during the daytime and these also
                                have low human disturbance.

                                While introduced foxes successfully colonised
                                mainland Australia, most Australian island have
                                remained fox free until now. Unfortunately,
                                there have been several illegal attempts to
                                introduce red foxes in Tasmania, an island off
                                the south-eastern coast of Australia, which
                                supports a great diversity of endemic species.

                                have been a number of introductions to
                                Tasmania. In 2001 the Tasmanian Government

                                incursion of foxes into the island. In 2006,
                                the Fox Free Taskforce examined all the
                                available evidence of the presence of foxes in
                                Tasmania and concluded that an unknown number
                                of foxes, and possibly their offspring, are
                                living in Tasmania and that action needs to be
                                taken to prevent the spread of this invader.
