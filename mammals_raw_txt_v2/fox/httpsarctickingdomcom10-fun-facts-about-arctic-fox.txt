 p By: Liz Carino  p 
 p While  a href="https:  arctickingdom.com trip-details " target="_blank" rel="noopener" polar bears are the most popular animals that   a travellers want to see and photograph when  a href="https:  arctickingdom.com arctic-safari " visiting the Arctic  a , the Arctic fox is another¬†favourite among guests!  p 
 p With their playful nature, once encountered, the Arctic fox instantly gains popularity with guests. Arctic foxes¬†have such a cheeky personality that they are also known as the ‚Äúclowns of the tundra‚Äù ‚Äì as our past guests and  a href="https:  arctickingdom.com arctic-kingdom-team " Expedition Leaders  a  on  a href="https:  arctickingdom.com safaris scheduled-safaris arviat-polar-bears overview " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" Polar Bear Migration Fly-In Photo Safari  a  can attest!  p 
 p What makes this small, Northern animal so remarkable? Here are 10 fun facts about Arctic fox:  p 
 p Their thick fur enables them to maintain a consistent body temperature and provides insulation. Plus, their short legs, short muzzle and rounded ears all reduce the amount of surface area for  a href="http:  www.canadiangeographic.ca article animal-facts-arctic-fox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" heat loss  a , and their feet are covered in fur.  p 
 p Once conditions get too cold, its metabolism increases to provide warmth.  p 
 p They are  a href="http:  www.canadiangeographic.ca article animal-facts-arctic-fox" related  a  to other foxes, wolves and dogs.  p 
 p In the summer the Arctic fox has a brown or great coat with a lighter belly. It then turns into a thick white one in the winter. It is the only canid that changes the  a href="http:  www.canadiangeographic.ca article animal-facts-arctic-fox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" colour  a  of its coat, allowing it to  a href="http:  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals arctic-fox " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" camouflage  a  with the snow and ice in the winter and rocks and plants in the summer.  p 
 p Females tend to be smaller than males, and their bushy tails make up  a href="http:  www.canadiangeographic.ca article animal-facts-arctic-fox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 30-35%  a  of their total length.  p 
 p They are carnivores and scavengers, and they hunt rodents, birds and even fish. In winter, prey can be scarce, prompting Arctic foxes to bring out their cheeky sides. They are known to follow in the footsteps of the Arctic‚Äôs premier predator, the polar bear, and feed on  a href="http:  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals arctic-fox " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" leftover scraps  a .  p 
 p They mate for life!  p 
 p They have large litters of 5-8 pups! Parents raise the pups together during the summer.  p 
 p But in a blizzard they are known to tunnel into the  a href="http:  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals arctic-fox " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" snow  a  to create shelter.  p 
 p View them in October and November on  a href="https:  arctickingdom.com trip polar-bear-migration-fly-photo-safari " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" Polar Bear Migration Fly-In Photo Safari.  a   p 
 p You can also see them in March on  a href="https:  arctickingdom.com trip polar-bear-photo-safari " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" Polar Bear Mother and Newborn Cubs Photo Safari  a .  p
