 p Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica and  a href="http:  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals red-fox " target="_blank" thrive  a  in cities, towns, and rural settings. But despite being all around us, they're a bit of a mystery. Here's more about this elusive animal.  p 
 p Foxes are part of the Canidae family, which means they're related to wolves, jackals, and dogs. They're medium-sized, between 7 and 15 pounds, with pointy faces, lithe frames, and bushy tails. But unlike their relatives, foxes are  a href="http:  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals red-fox " target="_blank" not pack animals  a . When raising their young, they live in small families—called a "leash of foxes" or a " a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 551081 collective-nouns-groups-animals" target="_self" skulk  a  of foxes"—in underground burrows. Otherwise, they hunt and sleep alone.  p 
 p Like the cat, the fox is most active after the sun goes down. In fact, it has vertically oriented pupils that allow it to see in dim light. It even hunts in a similar manner to a cat, by stalking and pouncing on its prey.  p 
 p And that's just the beginning of the similarities. Like the cat, the fox has sensitive whiskers and spines on its tongue. It walks on its toes, which accounts for its elegant, cat-like tread. And foxes are the only member of the dog family that can climb trees— a href="http:  www.wildlifelandtrust.org wildlife close-ups fox.html" target="_blank" gray foxes  a  have claws that allow them to climb and descend vertical trees quickly. Some foxes even sleep in trees—just like cats.  p 
 p Geographically, the red fox has the  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 23062 0" target="_blank" widest range  a  of the more than 280 animals in the order Carnivora. While its natural habitat is a mixed landscape of scrub and woodland, its flexible diet allows it to adapt to many environments. As a result, its range is the entire Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic Circle to North Africa to Central America to the Asiatic steppes. It's also in Australia, where it's considered an  a href="http:  www.environment.gov.au biodiversity invasive-species publications factsheet-european-red-fox-vulpes-vulpes" target="_blank" invasive species  a .  p 
 p Like a guided missile, the fox harnesses the earth's magnetic field to hunt. Other animals, like birds, sharks, and turtles, have this "magnetic sense," but the fox is the first one we've discovered that uses it to catch prey.  p 
 p According to  a href="http:  www.newscientist.com article dn19945-foxes-zero-in-on-prey-via-earths-magnetic-field.html#.VE7HBVNBH0o" target="_blank"  em New Scientist  em   a , the fox can see the earth's magnetic field as a "ring of shadow" on its eyes that darkens as it heads towards magnetic north. When the shadow and the sound the prey is making line up, it's time to pounce. Check out  a href="https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=D2SoGHFM18I" target="_blank" this video  a  of a fox in action.  p 
 p Foxes reproduce once a year. Litters range from one to 11 pups (the average is six), which are born blind and don't open their eyes until  a href="http:  www.esf.edu aec adks mammals red_fox.htm" target="_blank" nine days after birth  a . During that time, they stay with the vixen (female) in the den while the dog (male) brings them food. They live with their parents until they're seven months old. Vixens have been known to go to great lengths to protect their pups—once, in England, a fox pup was caught in a wire trap for two weeks but survived because its mother brought it food  a href="http:  www.dailymail.co.uk news article-1180392 Fox-cub-survives-weeks-trap-mother-brings-scraps-food-day.html" target="_blank" every day  a .  p 
 p Roughly the  a href="http:  www.livescience.com 27168-foxes.html" target="_blank" size of a kitten  a , the fennec fox has elongated ears and a creamy coat. It lives in the Sahara Desert, where it sleeps during the day to protect it from the searing heat. Its ears not only allow it to hear prey, they also  a href="http:  animals.nationalgeographic.com animals mammals fennec-fox " target="_blank" radiate body heat  a , which keeps the fox cool. Its paws are covered with fur so that the fox can walk on hot sand, like it's wearing snowshoes.  p 
 p Foxes are known to be friendly and curious. They play among themselves, as well as with other animals, like cats and dogs do. They love balls, which they will steal from backyards and  a href="https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=ul_fxYUgurg" target="_blank" golf courses  a .  p 
 p Although foxes are wild animals, their relationship with humans goes way back. In 2011, researchers opened a grave in a 16,500-year-old cemetery in Jordan to find the  a href="http:  www.cam.ac.uk research news was-the-fox-prehistoric-man%E2%80%99s-best-friend" target="_blank" remains  a  of a man and his pet fox. This was 4000 years before the first-known human and domestic dog were buried together.  p 
 p In the 1960s, a Soviet geneticist named Dmitry Belyaev  a href="https:  books.google.com books?id=8ZUtDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Dmitry+Belyaev&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY2qu-_P7cAhVEmlkKHRrkDzAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dmitry%20Belyaev&amp;f=false" target="_blank" bred  a  thousands of foxes before achieving a  a href="http:  www.cbsnews.com news adopt-a-pet-fox-for-sciences-sake " target="_blank" domesticated fox  a . Unlike a tame fox, which has learned to tolerate humans, a domesticated fox is docile toward people from birth. Today, you can buy a pet fox for $9000, according to  a href="http:  www.fastcompany.com 3037451 pet-week meet-your-new-pet-a-domesticated-fox" target="_blank" Fast Company  a . They're reportedly curious and sweet-tempered, though they are inclined to  a href="https:  www.popsci.com science article 2012-10 fyi-domesticated-foxes#page-13" target="_blank" dig  a  in the garden.  p 
 p The arctic fox, which lives in the northernmost areas of the hemisphere, can handle cold better than most animals on earth. It doesn't even get cold until  a href="http:  www.mnh.si.edu mna image_info.cfm?species_id=2" target="_blank" –70°C  a  (-94°F). Its white coat also camouflages it against predators. As the seasons change, its coat changes too, turning brown or gray so the fox can blend in with the rocks and dirt of the tundra.  p 
 p Perhaps because of the fox's ability to decimate a chicken coop, in the 16th century, fox hunting became a popular activity in Britain. In the 19th century, the upper classes turned fox hunting into a formalized sport where a pack of hounds and men on horseback chase a fox until it is killed. Today, whether to ban fox hunting continues to be a controversial subject in the UK. Currently, fox hunting with dogs is  a href="https:  www.gov.uk hunting mammals" target="_blank" not allowed  a .  p 
 p Examples include the nine-tail fox from various Asian cultures; the Reynard tales from medieval Europe; the sly trickster fox from Native American lore; and Aesop's " a href="http:  www.eastoftheweb.com short-stories UBooks FoxCrow.shtml" target="_blank" The Fox and the Crow  a ." The Finnish believed a fox made the Northern Lights by running in the snow so that its tail swept sparks into the sky. From this, we get the phrase "fox fires" (though "Firefox," like the Mozilla internet browser, refers to the  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 63578 12-furry-facts-about-red-pandas" target="_self" red panda  a ).  p 
 p The bat-eared fox is aptly named, not just because of its 5-inch ears, but because of what it uses those ears for—like the bat, it  a href="http:  www.pbs.org wnet nature animal-guide-bat-eared-fox 3249 " target="_blank" listens for insects  a . On a typical night, it walks along the African savannah, listening until it hears the scuttle of prey. Although the bat-eared fox eats a variety of insects and lizards, most of its diet is made up of  a href="http:  www.awf.org wildlife-conservation bat-eared-fox" target="_blank" termites  a . In fact, the bat-eared fox often  a href="http:  animals.sandiegozoo.org animals bat-eared-fox" target="_blank" makes its home  a  in termite mounds, which it usually cleans out of inhabitants before moving in.  p 
 p During his voyage on the  em Beagle  em , Charles Darwin collected a fox that today is unimaginatively called Darwin's Fox. This small gray fox is critically endangered and lives in just two spots in the world: One population is on Island of Chiloé in Chile, and the second is in a Chilean national park. The fox's greatest threats are unleashed domestic dogs that carry  a href="http:  www.arkive.org darwins-fox pseudalopex-fulvipes " target="_blank" diseases  a  like rabies.  p 
 p Foxes make 40 different sounds, some of which you can  a href="http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=J6NuhlibHsM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" listen to here  a . The most startling though might be its  a href="https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=zk1mAd77Hr4" target="_blank" scream  a .  p

 p Legend tells of St. Patrick using the power of his faith to drive all of Ireland’s snakes into the sea. It’s an impressive image, but there’s no way it could have happened.  p 
 p There never were any snakes in Ireland, partly for the  a href="http:  www.popsci.com why-doesnt-ireland-have-snakes" target="_blank" same reason  a  that there are no snakes in Hawaii, Iceland, New Zealand, Greenland, or Antarctica: the Emerald Isle is, well, an island.  p 
 p Once upon a time, Ireland was connected to a larger landmass. But that time was an ice age that kept the land far too chilly for cold-blooded reptiles. As the ice age ended around 10,000 years ago, glaciers melted, pouring even more cold water into the now-impassable expanse between Ireland and its neighbors.  p 
 p Other animals, like wild boars, lynx, and brown bears,  a href="http:  news.nationalgeographic.com news 2014 03 140315-saint-patricks-day-2014-snakes-ireland-nation " target="_blank" managed  a  to make it across—as did a single reptile: the common lizard. Snakes, however, missed their chance.  p 
 p The country’s serpent-free reputation has, somewhat perversely, turned snake ownership into a status symbol. There have been numerous  a href="http:  www.nytimes.com 2013 03 16 world europe boom-over-st-patricks-isle-is-slithering-again.html?_r=0" target="_blank" reports  a  of large pet snakes escaping or being released. As of yet, no species has managed to take hold in the wild—a small miracle in itself.  p

 p  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 87692 11-secrets-wildlife-photographers" target="_self" Wildlife photographers  a  have an eye for the majestic beauty of life on planet Earth, but they also know that nature has a silly side. This picture, captured by Maine photographer Roger Stevens Jr., shows a bald eagle and a gray squirrel locked in an epic staring match.  p 
 p As  a href="https:  www.wmtw.com article maine-photographer-captures-epic-standoff-between-bald-eagle-squirrel 26820935" target="_blank" WMTW Portland  a  reports, the image has been shared more than 8000 times since Stevens posted it on his  a href="https:  www.facebook.com photo.php?fbid=2382904465077329&amp;set=a.100530043314794&amp;type=3" target="_blank" Facebook  a  page. According to the post, the photo was taken behind a Rite Aid store in Lincoln, Maine. "I couldn't have made this up!!" Stevens wrote.  p 
 p 
Bald eagles eat small rodents like  a href="https:  www.nationaleaglecenter.org eagle-diet-feeding " target="_blank" squirrels  a , which is likely why the creatures were so interested in one another. But the staring contest didn't end with the bird getting his meal; after the photo was snapped, the squirrel escaped down a hole in the tree to safety.  p 
 p What was a life-or-death moment for the animals made for an entertaining picture. The photograph has over 400 comments, with Facebook users praising the photographer's timing and the squirrel's apparent bravery.  p 
 p Funny nature photos are common enough that there's an entire contest devoted to them. Here are some of  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 72711 here-are-winners-2015s-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards" target="_self" past winners  a  of the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards.  p
