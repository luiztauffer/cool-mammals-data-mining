 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="187" If its habitat starts to shrink and shift, several things can happen to a species. It can stay and adapt to new conditions. It can move with the habitat. Or it can do neither and die off.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="204" data-total-count="391" While there has been much research on what happens to species when habitat expands — no surprise, they tend to expand into it — there has been little research into what happens when habitat contracts.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="483" data-total-count="874" Love Dalen, currently at the University of London, and colleagues examined the subject using a species, the Arctic fox, whose habitat has changed markedly since the last ice age. Back then, 10,000 years ago, the species had the run of continental Europe, which because of the cold climate had tundra-like vegetation. But as the planet warmed again and the ice sheets receded, the fox’s habitat shifted northward and decreased. The animals are now found in Scandinavia and Siberia.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="1095" “We wanted to know what happened with the Arctic foxes over the transition from the ice age to the current warm period,” Dr. Dalen said. “When the tundra shifted up to Scandinavia and Siberia, did they move too?”  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="1348" The researchers analyzed  a href="http:  topics.nytimes.com top news health diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics geneticsandheredity index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival health news about genetics and heredity." class="meta-classifier" DNA  a  from fossilized fox bones found at European ice age sites, and compared it with DNA from the current Scandinavian and Siberian populations. They found that there was no connection between the ancient and modern populations.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="211" data-total-count="2353" Piezoelectric crystals have proved useful in industrial and consumer applications because of a special characteristic: they can be bent by electricity. (Conversely, they can also generate electricity when bent.)  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="2463" But to be so useful, piezoelectric crystals must still be wired so the electricity can flow to or from them.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="353" data-total-count="2816" How great would it be, then, to have a crystal that could work “wirelessly” — bending when exposed to light, for example? Seiya Kobatake  of Osaka City University in Japan and colleagues have developed such a crystal that can reversibly change its shape when exposed to alternating ultraviolet and visible light. Their  a href="http:  www.nature.com nature journal v446 n7137 abs nature05669.html" target="_blank" work  a  is described in Nature.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="3308" Materials that can be deformed by photoirradiation are not unknown, but generally consist of polymer films and gels and are rather slow-acting. The new research used diarylethene chromophores, ringed molecules that switch from an open-ring version, or isomer, to a closed-ring isomer when irradiated with ultraviolet light, and back to an open-ring isomer when exposed to visible light. Those changes alter the shape of crystals made up of these molecules, from a square to more of a diamond.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="3531" This quality was put to use in a crystal rod attached to a substrate at one end. When exposed to ultraviolet light from one side, the side near the light changed shape, causing the  rod to bend in 25-millionths of a second.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="133" data-total-count="3664" id="story-continues-4" The force generated was powerful enough to shoot a gold particle that was much heavier than the crystal a distance of 30 micrometers.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="3789" The researchers say the materials may someday be used to make microscopic actuators that would need no wired source of power.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="4164" As spiral galaxies go, M106, found 23 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici, is far from typical. Sure, it has a nucleus and arms of stars and gas (visible in green in the composite image below). But radio astronomy and X-ray data (in purple and blue) show that it has two other arms as well.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="155" data-total-count="4319" These shadow arms have been a puzzle, with some suggestions that they are jets of particles emitted by a supermassive black hole at the galaxy’s center.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="4533" But that’s not the precise explanation, according to study by Yuxuan Yang of the University of Maryland and colleagues to be published in The Astrophysical Journal. The jets are only indirectly creating the arms.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="4780" The jets are tilted about 30 degrees from the galactic plane. The researchers say these streams heat gases that  in turn collide violently with gases in the disk, heating them to such an extent that they emit the radio waves and X-rays observed.  p
