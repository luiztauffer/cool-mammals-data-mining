The Arctic Ring of Life is home to three female arctic foxes, all sisters. The oldest, Alex, came to the Detroit Zoo in 2008. She tends to hang back on her own away from Roxanne and Moxie, who joined her here in 2010. Roxanne seems to have taken on the role of dominant female. Her litter mate, Moxie, appears to follow in the shadow of her sister. The Arctic Ring of Life is one of North America’s largest polar bear habitats, and also houses seals. This state-of-the-art, interactive facility encompasses over 4 acres of outdoor and indoor habitats and was named the second-best exhibit at any zoo in the U.S. by The Intrepid Traveler’s guide to America’s Best Zoos. br

Description  strong  br 
Arctic foxes’ bodies are short and compact to help keep them warm during frigid temperatures. Their feet are covered in fur to provide traction on the rough tundra terrain. During the winter, their fur color is white and during the summer it turns to a brownish-gray, which allows them to remain camouflaged year round.  p 
 p Since the arctic fox has impeccable hearing, it is able to pinpoint the exact location of prey that is under the snow. It catches its hidden prey by pouncing through the snow and landing on top of it.  p 
 p The arctic fox is also known as the white fox, polar fox and ice fox.  p
