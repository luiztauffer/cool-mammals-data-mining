 p  strong class="dateline" SARASOTA, Fla. (FOX 13)  strong  - Animals have been a part of circus life for decades but when they retire from the spotlight, where do they go? One of the options is Big Cat Habitat right here in the Bay Area.    p 
 p Big Cat Habitat is the permanent home for dozens of exotic animals, including Brutus the liger.  He’s a half lion, half-tiger who is “a Happy Meal short of a thousand pounds,” according to the sanctuary’s Doc Wasabi.  p 
 p “Brutus was born at a zoo in Minnesota. They had a lion and a tiger together in a large enclosure for 10 years thinking they’re too old to breed. Well, one day, they walk in, two cubs were there. But zoos don’t like to crossbreed species so we ended up with Brutus and his sister, Mia.”  p 
 p Aside from Brutus and Mia, the facility is home to 54 big cats, 13 bears, and 400 other animals, from alligators to porcupines.  They were all retired or rescued from all kinds of situations around the country.  p 
 p The sanctuary is open to visitors Wednesday through Sunday.  p

 p Mr. Pastrami in New Port Richey is a Brooklyn-style deli owned by native Brooklynites who have been in the restaurant biz for more than 30 years.  While their story is a good one, it’s not what drew FOX 13 viewers AnneMarie and Ron Nece to the spot.   p 
 p Instead, it was the food.  p 
 p That’s why they brought FOX 13’s Chip Brewster and his Bay Area Best segment to the relatively new spot.  p

 p You know about the tiny house craze, but how about a tiny restaurant? In downtown Dunedin, taco lovers will find a lot of taste in a tiny place called Taco Baby.  p 
 p “It’s 54 square feet inside, which is just enough room to fit two humans who can serve you tacos,” offered Kurt Ferguson, owner of Nina Hospitality Co.  “They have to be friends, though.”   p 
 p How new is it? Look up their address of 235 Main Street on Google Earth and you'll find the photo still shows a Chase ATM machine.  That stand-alone ATM has been transformed into this unique taco stand.   p

 p As the leader of a Bay Area movement called shelling, Captain Rick Sutton finds solace on the sea.   p 
 p "There's deer season, there's duck season, and there is a shell season," Sutton explained.  p 
 p Through social media sites like Facebook, shelling has become one of the fastest-growing hobbies. One Florida group called The Shellinators boasts almost 20,000 members and is growing.   p
