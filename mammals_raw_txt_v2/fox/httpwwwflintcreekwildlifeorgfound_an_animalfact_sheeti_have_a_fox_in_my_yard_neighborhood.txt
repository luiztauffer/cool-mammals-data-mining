 p We frequently get calls from people worried because they've seen an adult Red Fox in their yard or neighborhood or perhaps they even have a Fox den with kits (baby Fox) under their deck or shed. This fact sheet will help you with what to do. If you still have questions  or the fox is injured, please call us at (847) 842-8000.  p
