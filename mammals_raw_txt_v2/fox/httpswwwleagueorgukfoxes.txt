 p Just call him Fantastic Mr Fox! Foxes are amazing animals, but how much do you know about them?  p 
 p Check out our fox facts below!  p 
 p Foxes are hunted by packs of fox hounds and people¬†mounted on horses or on foot. This is mostly illegal under the  a href=" hunting-act" target="_self"  span class="post_link" Hunting Act 2004  span   a  but unfortunately still continues. Foxes are also killed as cubs as part of ‚Äò a href=" cub-hunting" target="_self"  span class="post_link" cub hunting  span   a ‚Äô, also known as ‚ÄòAutumn hunting‚Äô which takes place before the main fox hunting season begins in November.  p 
 p Foxes are also captured by hunts and kept in ‚Äòartificial earths‚Äô or disused buildings, so they can then be released in front of the hounds during the hunt. This proves that fox hunting is nothing to do with ‚Äòfox control‚Äô or ‚Äòwildlife management‚Äô, as the hunts claim, and is purely about providing sport for the hunters.  p 
 p Foxes are also caught in  a href=" snares" target="_self"  span class="post_link" snares  span   a , which are wire nooses laid in the countryside, often around shooting estates. The aim is to catch foxes so that they don‚Äôt kill the grouse, pheasants or partridges on the estates ‚Äì which will then be killed for sport  p
