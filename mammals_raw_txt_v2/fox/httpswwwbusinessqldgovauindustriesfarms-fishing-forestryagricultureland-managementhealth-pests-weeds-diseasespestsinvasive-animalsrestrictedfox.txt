 p Native to the northern hemisphere, the European red fox is 1 of 11 canid species worldwide. The fox was introduced to Australia from England as a sport animal during the 1860s and became a pest species within 30 years. Today, foxes are widespread throughout most of mainland Australia. Foxes threaten Australia’s agricultural and native species.  p
