 p Much of the high population of the red fox can be awarded to the 
			fact that they don't require specific resources in their 
			environment.  They prefer to have a dry, and 
			wooded area with lots of shrubs. Urban environments provide a great 
			area for them to raise their young. They can be found in many 
			habitats such as tundra, deserts, and forests, even in large cities 
			including London, Paris, and Stockholm (C.P. Doncaster and D.W. 
			Macdonald 1991). 
			Recently, they were also introduced to Australia. Extreme deserts, 
			the Arctic islands, Iceland, and some parts of Siberia are only a 
			few of the places where red foxes are not inhabitants (The IUCN Red 
			List of Threatened Species 2013). a href="http:  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons 3 3d Isle_Royale_fox.jpg" target="_blank" title="A fox at Snug Harbor, Isle Royale, taken by Todd VerBeek.

 p  “Spread about from the Arctic Circle to Central America, the 
			steppes of Central Asia, and northern Africa. This species has the 
			widest distribution of any canid” (Animal Diversity Web 2013). As 
			previously stated, the red fox can be found anywhere, interacting 
			with wide range of other animals such as, deer, bears, coyotes, 
			rabbits, squirrels and other woodland creatures(see more in
			 a href="interactions.htm" Interactions  a ).  p 
 p    p 
 p Within these wooded areas, dens provide shelter and support for 
			these animals. Dens can be found in small crevices in rocks, within 
			hollow logs, or even underground. Sometimes red foxes dig their own 
			dens although sometimes they get lucky and reuse the den of the 
			previous inhabitant (See European Badger in
			 a href="interactions.htm" Interactions  a ). Generally, slopes are 
			a very popular place to harbor a fox den. While outside the opening 
			lies some distinct features exclusive to fox dens. Large soil piles 
			cover the various openings of the hole. Here is where the young come 
			to socialize. Also, “accumulations of parts of prey, feces, and 
			urine are another characteristic of dens” (Adriondack Ecological 
			Center 2013).   p
