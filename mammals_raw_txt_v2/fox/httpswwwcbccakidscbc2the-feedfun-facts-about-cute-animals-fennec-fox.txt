	Fennec foxes are really tiny, about the size of a small cat when grown. They look like miniature foxes except for one big difference – their ears. They’re huge! Each ear is about the size of the fox’s face. These ears not only make the fennec fox look cute, they also help the foxes survive in one of harshest climates in the world – the deserts of North Africa.  p

	Those ears are definitely better to hear you with – the fennec fox use them to hunt, they can hear bugs and animals moving even underground. But hearing isn’t the only thing their big ears are good for. They also keep the foxes cool. Just like a vent on a furnace, the fennec foxes’ ears get rid of extra heat and keep them comfortable even in the hot desert temperatures. br

	Their ears aren’t the only way the fennec fox handles the desert. They’re nocturnal, which means they’re awake during the nighttime. They sleep in underground dens during the day so they don’t have to be in the hot sun. If they do have to go out when it’s sunny, their fur coats protect them from sunburn. Then at night that same fur keeps them warm – it’s an outfit that works no matter what time of day! They even have fur on the bottom of their feet so their paws don’t get burned from the hot sand.  p

	The fennec foxes use their paws to dig out dens underground. The fox parents live in the den with their babies, called kits. There are often other dens nearby with other foxes families, fennecs are social and like to play. They’ve even been heard to purr when happy.  p

	Fennecs may be the smallest of all foxes, but they can jump! Fennec foxes can jump straight up as high as 61 centimeters. That may not sound like a lot but these foxes are only 20 cm tall, so they’re jumping three times their height! They can also jump distances of 120 cm. If there were a fox track and field event, they would win high jump and long jump easily.  p

	Fennec foxes would be great dinner guests – they eat anything! Animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores. Mostly fennecs eat insects and mice, but they also like eggs and fruit, especially the dates that grow around the desert. Fennecs need very little water and mostly get it from their food.  p
