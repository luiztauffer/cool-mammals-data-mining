 p Despite  their dainty appearance, desert kit foxes are hardy animals, well adapted for  living in the hot, harsh desert habitat from which they never stray. This cat-sized  kit fox subspecies has long, delicate ears to radiate heat (and for great hearing);  a grayish coat for camouflage; a light, slim body and short legs for quick  dashes after prey; and even fur on its paw pads, for traction in the desert sands  and protection from their scalding surface. Desert kit foxes use water  efficiently and don't drink much, getting most hydration from food they  consume. They're primarily active during the cool night, lounging by day in burrow  systems where they take refuge from hot and cold temperatures as well as from predators,  including coyotes and golden eagles.  p 
 p You can see the keyhole-shaped entrances of  kit fox burrows scattered across a wide area of California's Mojave and  Colorado deserts. But these wild-canine quarters are increasingly empty — or  destroyed — due to large-scale industrial energy development rapidly on the  rise across the kit fox range. Even smart, climate-saving clean-energy  development like solar projects are often badly sited and destroy important kit  fox habitat — and also, possibly, help spread kit fox-killing diseases like  canine distemper: In Riverside County in 2011 and 2012, the first-ever  documented outbreak of the disease in desert kit fox caused a local die-off  when it hit desert kit foxes in an area surrounding the Genesis Solar energy  development site. Other threats to the  foxes abound, including grazing, urbanization, agriculture, climate change and mortality  from vehicles on roads that are increasingly crisscrossing their range — as  well as off-road vehicles that drive over dens, potentially causing cave-ins that  crush kit fox pups.  p 
 p To  defend the desert kit fox and its dry, scrubby, but ecologically vital habitat,  in March 2013 the Center  a href="pdfs Desert-kit-fox-CESA-petition-3-10-13.pdf" petitioned   a California to  protect the desert kit fox as threatened under the California Endangered  Species Act. State protection would afford this cute, keystone creature a  better chance at surviving the California energy-development boom.  p
