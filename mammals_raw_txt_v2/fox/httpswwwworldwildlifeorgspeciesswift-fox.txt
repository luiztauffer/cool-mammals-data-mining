 p Although historically common and widely distributed in short- and mixed-grass prairies of the Great Plains, swift foxes have experienced significant population declines and are now estimated to occupy less than half of their historic range in the United States. In the face of this enormous decline, a multi-stakeholder, comprehensive approach is required to restore swift fox populations across the Northern Great Plains and beyond. Collaboration among tribal communities, universities, conservation organizations, state and government agencies, and private landowners is essential for the swift fox to make a viable comeback.  p 
 p Where present, swift foxes are indicators an intact grassland ecosystem. Conserving habitat for and populations of swift foxes benefits other wildlife species that share similar habitat, such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and grassland birds.  p

 p To ensure the long-term survival and stability of swift fox populations range-wide, WWF works with a diverse group of stakeholders on three priorities:  p
