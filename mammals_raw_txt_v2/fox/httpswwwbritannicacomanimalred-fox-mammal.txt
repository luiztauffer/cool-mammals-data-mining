It has the largest natural distribution of any land  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal mammal" class="md-crosslink" mammal  a  except human beings. First introduced to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Australia" class="md-crosslink" Australia  a  in the 19th century, it has since established itself throughout much of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science continent" class="md-crosslink" continent  a .  p 
 p Widely held as a symbol of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal animal" class="md-crosslink autoxref" animal  a  cunning, the red fox is the subject of considerable  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic folklore-academic-discipline" class="md-crosslink" folklore  a . In addition, red foxes are  span id="ref1254120"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com sports foxhunting" class="md-crosslink" hunted  a  for sport and for their fur and are raised commercially for pelts.  p 
 p Red foxes are generally about 90–105 cm (36–42 inches) long—about 35–40 cm (14–16 inches) of this being the tail—and stand about 40 cm tall at the shoulder. Most adults weigh about 5–7 kg (10–15 pounds), but the largest individuals may approach 14 kg (31 pounds). The red fox has a coat of long guard hairs and soft fine underfur that is typically a rich reddish brown. Its  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science tail-zoology" class="md-crosslink" tail  a  is often white-tipped, and it has black ears and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science leg-anatomy" class="md-crosslink" legs  a . Its colour, however, is variable. In North America, black and silver coats are found, with a variable amount of white or white-banded hair occurring in a black coat, and these animals are sometimes called  span id="ref1251394"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal silver-fox" class="md-crosslink" silver foxes  a . A form called the  span id="ref1251395"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal cross-fox" class="md-crosslink" cross, or brant, fox  a  is yellowish brown with a black cross extending between the shoulders and down the back. It is found in both North America and the Old World. The  span id="ref1251393"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal Samson-fox" class="md-crosslink" Samson fox  a  is a mutant strain of red fox found in northwestern Europe. It lacks the long guard hairs, and the underfur is tightly curled.  p 
 p The preferred habitat of red foxes is a mixed landscape—made up of patches of forests, grasslands, and other land-use types—but they live in  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary environments" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="environments" environments  a  ranging from Arctic  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science tundra" class="md-crosslink" tundra  a  to arid  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science desert" class="md-crosslink" desert  a . Red foxes adapt very well to human presence, thriving in areas with farmland and woods, and populations can be found in many large  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic city" class="md-crosslink" cities  a , suburbs, and other  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science urban-ecosystem" class="md-crosslink" urban ecosystems  a .  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal mouse-rodent" class="md-crosslink" Mice  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal vole" class="md-crosslink" voles  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal rabbit" class="md-crosslink" rabbits  a , as well as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science egg-biology" class="md-crosslink" eggs  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science fruit-plant-reproductive-body" class="md-crosslink" fruit  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal bird-animal" class="md-crosslink" birds  a , make up most of the diet, but foxes readily eat other available food such as carrion,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic cereal" class="md-crosslink" grain  a  (especially  a href="https:  www.britannica.com plant sunflower-plant" class="md-crosslink" sunflower  a  seeds), garbage, pet food left unattended overnight, and domestic  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal poultry-agriculture" class="md-crosslink" poultry  a .  p 
 p By the middle of the 20th century,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal wolf" class="md-crosslink" wolves  a  and other large predators, whose  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science aggressive-behaviour" class="md-crosslink" aggressive behaviour  a  and territoriality tend to check the activities of red foxes, had been largely removed by humans from the urban and agricultural areas of Europe and North America. This development has allowed red foxes—as well as other medium-sized predators (or  span id="ref1254121"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science mesopredator-release" class="md-crosslink" mesopredators  a ) such as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal coyote-mammal" class="md-crosslink" coyotes  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal raccoon" class="md-crosslink" raccoons  a —to hunt, forage, and breed without fear of encountering a larger, more-aggressive  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science competition-biotic-interaction" class="md-crosslink" competitor  a , which, in turn, has allowed red foxes  to place substantial hunting pressure on birds and other prey. On the prairies of North America, it is estimated that red foxes kill close to one million  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal mallard" class="md-crosslink" wild ducks  a  each year. Their impact on domestic birds and some wild game birds has led to their numbers often being regulated near game farms and bird-production areas.  p 
 p The red fox is hunted for sport and for its  span id="ref1254122"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic fur-animal-skin" class="md-crosslink" pelt  a , which is a mainstay of the fur trade ( em see also  em   a href="https:  www.britannica.com sports foxhunting" class="md-crosslink" foxhunting  a ). Fox pelts, especially those of silver foxes, are commonly produced on fox farms, where the animals are raised until they are fully grown at approximately 10 months of age. In much of their range, red foxes are the primary carrier of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science rabies" class="md-crosslink" rabies  a . Several countries, especially the United Kingdom and France, have extensive culling and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science vaccine" class="md-crosslink" vaccination  a  programs aimed at reducing the incidence of rabies in red foxes.  p 
 p Red foxes mate in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science winter" class="md-crosslink" winter  a . After a  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science gestation" class="md-crosslink" gestation  a  period of seven or eight weeks, the female (vixen) gives birth to 1–10 or more (5 is average) young (kits, cubs, or pups). Birth takes place in a den, which is commonly a  span id="ref1163104"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science burrowing" class="md-crosslink" burrow  a  abandoned by another animal. It is often enlarged by the parent foxes. The cubs remain in the den for about five weeks and are cared for by both parents throughout the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science summer-season" class="md-crosslink" summer  a . The young disperse in the fall once they are fully grown and independent.  p
