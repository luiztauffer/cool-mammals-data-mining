      Historically, the swift fox was widely distributed from southern Canada to
      the panhandle of Texas, and from northwest Montana to western Minnesota.
      The swift fox once inhabited all of North Dakota's prairies.  font   p

      Swift fox populations have been reduced to about 40 percent of their former
      range. The swift was extirpated in Canada, but the animal has been
      recently reintroduced in Saskatchewan. Swift fox populations are still
      healthy in the southern United States. In North Dakota, no swift fox sightings
      were reported from 1915 to 1970. In 1970, a swift fox
      carcass was found in Slope County. In 1976 and in 1990, single individuals
      were observed in North Dakota in Mercer County and Golden Valley County. 
      Swift fox are apparently absent from North Dakota, although several recent
      observations suggest the species may exist in extremely low densities in
      the southwestern counties.  font   p 
 p align="left"  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="4" Habitat  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" :  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" 
      The swift fox prefers short- to mid-grass prairies with little or no
      shrubs. They also inhabit areas of mixed agricultural use, but in these
      areas, population densities are lower. Prairie dog towns are a preferred
      habitat of swift fox.  font   p 
 p align="left"  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="4" Life History  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" :  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" 
      Swift fox breed when they are 1 to 2 years old. Breeding occurs in
      February and early March, with the gestation period being 52-53 days. The
      average litter size is 4 to 5 pups. The young emerge from the dens at 3 to
      4 weeks and are weaned at 6 to 7 weeks. The young will stay with the
      adults about 4 or 5 months. Swift fox can live up to 10 years in the wild.
      Dens are used on a daily basis all year round. Dens may be excavated by
      the swift fox or they may use old badger holes or prairie dog burrows.
      Prairie dogs, rabbits, small birds, insects, and plant parts make up the
      main portion of the diet. Swift fox readily feed on carrion. Swift fox are
      primarily nocturnal (come out at night). Coyotes, eagles, and hawks have
      been reported as predators of swift fox. Coyotes have probably become a
      more severe predator of the swift fox, since the extirpation of the
      prairie wolf. In pre-settlement times, the prairie wolf controlled coyote
      numbers and hence, protected the swift fox.  font   p

      Identification  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" :  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" 
      The swift fox averages 5 pounds and measures about 3 feet from head to
      tail. It is about the size of a house cat. The color is orangeish-tan on
      the back, fading to a light tan on the belly. The tip of the tail is black
      and there are black spots on the muzzle. The swift fox is about one-half
      the size of the red fox. The red fox has a white-tipped tail. The swift
      fox is found only on the western prairies, while the larger gray fox is
      found only in the eastern forests.  font   p 
 p align="left"  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="4" Reasons for
      Decline  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" :  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" 
      The swift fox has declined as a consequence of the increase in agriculture
      and the disappearance of the native prairies. Widespread shooting,
      trapping, and poisoning campaigns aimed at wolves, coyote, and red fox
      also reduced swift fox populations. Swift fox are very easy to trap and
      very susceptible to poisoned bait. They also get hit by cars when foraging
      along the sides of roads.  font   p 
 p align="left"  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="4" Recommendations  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" :  font  font face="Lucida Sans Unicode" size="3" 
      Notify the Fish and Wildlife Service if you observe a swift fox in North
      Dakota.  font   p

      The taxonomy of the swift fox has been a source of confusion and debate.
      Many researchers now dispute the old claim of there being a Northern swift
      fox and a Southern swift fox. Some recent publications have suggested that
      the swift fox and the kit fox ( i Vulpes macrotis  i ) of the southwestern
      deserts of the United States are actually the same species. There have
      been several petitions to list the swift fox as endangered or threatened,
      but the requests were determined to be not warranted. Swift fox were
      historically trapped for their fur, but their pelts are of low quality and
      small in size.  font   p
