 p Zebras have a narrow, mostly vertical black and white striped coat. The patterns of their distinctive stripes are as individual as a human fingerprint. They live in small family groups of four to nine animals, led by a single stallion with one to six mares and their offspring. Males that are not leading a family group form bachelor groups until they establish their own herd. Mares give birth to a single foal after 12 monthsâ€™ gestation. All species of zebra are closely related to the horse and the ass.  p 
 p Common zebras are widespread throughout Africa. They are found in southern Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Like all equines, zebras are grazers and are restricted to African savanna and grassland habitats. Typical habitat is a flat, open plain, grassy, or at least with sufficient ground vegetation to sustain a grazing animal.  p 
 p Zebras are fairly abundant, especially in national parks and reserves. Nevertheless, zebras suffer from the spread of agriculture, which removes large amounts of grassland for farm use.  p
