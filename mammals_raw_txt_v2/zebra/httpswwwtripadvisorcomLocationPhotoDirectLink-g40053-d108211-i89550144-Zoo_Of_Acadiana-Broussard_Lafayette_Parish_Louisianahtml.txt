We just did a quick walk-thru of the zoo one afternoon. There seemed to be a lot of activities for kids (we were there on a cold day in the off season, so many weren't open operating), like a zoo tour train, nice playground, and nice gift shop. We enjoyed the more treed setting in this zoo, and loved the alligator...
