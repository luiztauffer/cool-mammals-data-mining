 p How much does getting someone's phone number mean to  em you  em ? In Oklahoma City, it apparently means a whole lot, as a teenage boy reportedly braved zebras, risking his life at the  a href="http:  www.teenvogue.com tag zoo" Oklahoma City Zoo  a  to get one,  a class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http:  kfor.com 2017 05 09 teenager-in-hot-water-after-allegedly-climbing-into-enclosure-at-oklahoma-city-zoo-on-a-dare "}' href="http:  kfor.com 2017 05 09 teenager-in-hot-water-after-allegedly-climbing-into-enclosure-at-oklahoma-city-zoo-on-a-dare " rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" according to  em KFOR  em   a .  p 
 p On Monday afternoon, an unidentified 16-year-old boy was caught jumping not one, but two, fences to get into the animal habitat yard. It’s unclear whether the teen thought that coming into contact with the zebras would be no more eventful than walking up to Marty from  em Madagascar  em , but the  em multiple  em  barriers at the Oklahoma City Zoo between the crowd and the animals seemed to have been scant deterrents for the boy on a mission.  em KFOR  em  reported that, when questioned, the teen confessed to going through with the stunt “on a dare” from his friends. Apparently,  friends informed the teen that, if he went through with the feat, he would be given the phone number of a girl he liked.  p 
 p The zoo security officers spotted the boy, though not before he had already entered the zebras' home. He did not, however, come into contact with any of the animals, which is a stroke of luck for both parties. He was then held at the zoo until the Oklahoma City police arrived to charge him. The teen was ticketed for criminal trespassing and sent home with his father. The deputy director of the Oklahoma City Zoo was quoted by the news source, saying, “The safety and security of both our guests and animals is our priority. Our animal habitats are designed both to keep animals in and to keep the public out, so situations such as this do not occur. The young man put himself in a serious situation, which endangered himself, our animals, and staff.”  p 
 p But dude, we're just saying: if you had to risk your life to get someone's phone number, maybe take the hint that they're not as into you as you are them?  p
