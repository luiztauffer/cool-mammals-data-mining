 p Want to unlock all the rare and unusual animals in Featherweight's addictive new auto-runner,  em Rodeo Stampede  em ? Here's our guide to doing just that.  p 
 p When you first play Rodeo Stampede, you'll only ever see Buffalo, Zebras, and Elephants.  p 
 p To add more animal species you must complete missions and other objectives, which will let you travel to new locations on the map screen.  p 
 p With each new location, new animals are added.  p 
 p However, that will only add the most basic version of that animal.  p 
 p To make other types of animal (such as an ostrich with a guitar or an elephant wearing a crown) spawn in the game you need to upgrade that animal's habitat. This costs money.  p 
 p For most animals, the first time you upgrade the habitat (level 1), some extra types of that animal will appear in the stampede. The last time you upgrade (level 8), even more animals will appear.  p 
 p They'll be rarer, and so less likely to appear.  p 
 p Most rare animals will only appear after you have travelled a long distance.  p 
 p Some animals are bosses. You can access these boss missions after finishing lots of missions.  p 
 p And some are secret, and will only appear after certain criteria have been met. Click through to find out how to get the lot:  p
