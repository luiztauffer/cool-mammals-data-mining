 p These zebra are native to savannah habitats.  p 
 p Mainly grass, and occasionally shrubs.  p 
 p The striking black and white markings of these sociable animals act as amazing camouflage when a herd of zebras stand together – as it is hard to tell where one animal ends and another one begins. Zebra families will often join up with other zebra, wildebeest and antelope to form ‘super-herds’ during a constant migration, where they travel thousands of miles in search of fresh green pastures.  p 
 p These zebras don’t have mating seasons, but most births will occur during rainy periods. One foal will be born after a gestation period of 13 months. A foal will stand to suckle soon after birth, and will start to graze at two weeks old.  p 
 p Predators of the zebra include lions, hunting dogs, leopards and cheetahs. When threatened these zebras will form a semi-circle, facing their attackers, and when a member of their herd is injured, the rest of the zebra will encircle it for protection.  p
