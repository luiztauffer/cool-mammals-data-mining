 p The zebra longwing butterfly or  zebra heliconian,  em Heliconius charitonia,  em  is unmistakable with its long narrow wings, which are striped black and pale yellow.  This species is common in Mexico  and Central America and it is also found in most of Florida  and in some areas of Texas,  where it can be seen year round. Occasionally it wanders farther north as far  as South Carolina  and some of the central states, although it is not likely to survive the cold. Florida designated this  striking creature as its state butterfly in 1996.  p 
 p They fly slowly and gracefully and  are not easily startled. They gather in roosts to spend the night returning to  the same place daily; all this making it easy to observe them. After mating the  female lays eggs on one of several species of passion flower plants  em Passiflora  em . The caterpillars feed on these  plants and acquire some of their toxins; this makes them distasteful to  predators. The striking colors and pattern of the adults advertise their  toxicity.  p 
 p An unusual feature of the longwing,  or heliconian, butterflies is that the adults are relatively long lived. Most other  butterflies live only a few weeks, but heliconians continue to live and to lay  eggs for several months. Their tropical or semitropical habitat makes this  possible; furthermore the feeding habits of the adults are important in  prolonging their lives. The adults feed on nectar of flowers, like most other  butterflies, but a special characteristic of heliconian butterflies is that  they can also feed on pollen.  p 
 p Most butterflies can only sip fluids  with their specialized mouth parts, but the heliconian butterflies take some  pollen as well as nectar. Their saliva enables them to dissolve the pollen and  to take their nutrients. Pollen is very nutritious, rich in proteins, unlike  nectar which contains almost no proteins, just sugars. This diet allows the  butterflies to prolong their lives and also enables them to continue producing  eggs for several months. As a consequence they are more dependent on flowers  than other types of butterflies and this makes them good pollinators. They feed  on a wide range of flowers; some of their favorites are lantana ( em Lantana  em , Verbenaceae family) and  shepherd's needle ( em Bidens pilosa  em ,  Asteraceae family). It is also possible that they develop a sort of symbiosis  with those plants that provide their preferred pollen.   p 
 p Zebra longwing and other  heliconians have a reputation for being very intelligent insects. They have a social  order when roosting; the oldest ones choose the best places. They also gently  nudge the others early in the morning to get going. Another interesting  characteristic of heliconian butterflies is that they can remember their food  sources and return daily to the plants where they fed previously, a behavior  known as trap lining. The memory is so strong that if one shrub in their route  is cut down they return to the location again and again only to search in vain.  p 
 p A relative of this butterfly, the Red  Postman ( em Heliconius erato  em ), is seen  occasionally in Texas.  It is also very beautiful, black with white and red markings. Its  life style is similar to that of the zebra longwing.  p
