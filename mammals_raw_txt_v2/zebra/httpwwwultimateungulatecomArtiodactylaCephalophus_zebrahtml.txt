 p   The zebra duiker's light gold or reddish-brown body is strikingly marked from the shoulders to the rump with 12-16 black (or dark brown) transverse stripes. The striping pattern (number of stripes, degree of tapering, and arrangement) is unique to each individual. The shoulders and lower legs are darker than the rest of the body, and blackish bands encircle the upper legs (both front and rear). The undersides are pale. The tail is rufous and lacks stripes. The face is an overall deep chestnut brown color; there are no distinctive markings, but the muzzle is black and the lower jaw whitish. The horns are short, smooth, sharp cones in both males (4-5 cm) and females (up to 2-3 cm).

 p The zebra duiker is a diurnal species, but is shy and rarely seen in the wild. The normal social unit appears to be a breeding pair; the pair bond is reinforced with mutual rubbing, licking, and scent-marking. This species is thought to be territorial, and (based on heavy scars in many individuals) appears to fight quite vigorously.  Although generally quiet, both sexes my make throaty grunting sounds during courtship.  p

 p  The zebra duiker is highly dependent on mature rainforest, and is thus one of the first species to disappear with logging. Recent population estimates suggest that only 15,000 individuals may survive in the wild.
