 p Grevy’s Zebras are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with a wild population estimated at fewer than 2,000 individuals. Their largest threats come from loss of habitat, competition with livestock, and poaching. They have disappeared from most of their former habitats and are now only found in dry deserts and open grasslands in northern Kenya and southeastern Ethiopia.  p 
 p There are three different species of zebra: Plains or Common Zebra, Mountain Zebra, and Grevy’s Zebra. Grevy’s Zebra were named for Jules Grevy, a former president of France, to whom the first known specimen of the animal was sent in 1882. The largest of all wild equine species, they can be distinguished from other zebras by their longer legs, more narrow stripes, white, stripe-less underbellies, and large rounded ears.  p
