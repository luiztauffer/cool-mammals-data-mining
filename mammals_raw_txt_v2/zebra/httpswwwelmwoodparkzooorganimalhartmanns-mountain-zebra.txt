 p A Hartmann’s mountain zebra has a distinctive black and white stripped pattern. As their name suggests, they exhibit amazing climbing abilities like scaling over mountains. Hartmann’s mountain zebras can be discovered 2000 meters above sea level. Unlike other members of the horse family, they have very hard, pointed hooves, which allow them to climb the rocky terrain. It is very common to find Hartmann’s mountain zebras chasing, play fighting, and racing.  p 
 p Because of the demand for land for agriculture and grassland for livestock animals, the zebra’s habitat is being destroyed and leaves them to compete with cattle for grazing areas. Zebras are hunted, both legally and illegally, many times so landowners have more room to farm.  p
