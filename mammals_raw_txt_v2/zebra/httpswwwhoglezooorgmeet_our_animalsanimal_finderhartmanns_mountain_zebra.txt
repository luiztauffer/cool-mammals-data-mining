 p Hartmann’s mountain zebras range from South West Africa into extreme southwest Angola. They are found in six distinct populations.   p 
 p Slopes and plateaus in mountainous areas.  p 
 p A mountain zebra has narrow stripes on the neck and torso, which graduate to wider stripes on the rear. The legs are striped all the way down to the hooves. It has a gridiron pattern on the rump, and its white underside has a dark stripe that runs the length of the belly. Unlike other zebras, the mountain zebra has a dewlap, or fold of skin, hanging from the throat. The mane is short and erect, with no forelock. The mountain zebra is a good climber and has very hard and pointed hooves compared to other zebras and horses.   p 
 p Mountain zebra are mainly crepuscular – active in the early morning and late afternoon to sunset. Grazing and resting occupy most of the daylight hours. Mountain zebras usually drink once or twice per day. During cold weather, they shelter in wooded areas or caves, and go to east-facing slopes to warm up in the morning sunshine. Hartmann’s mountain zebras live on the edge of the Namib Desert, and as a result they have to range widely to find surface water.  p 
 p Mountain zebra form small herds of one adult stallion and 1 to 5 mares with young. Breeding herds remain stable over many years and mares usually remain in a herd for life. Gestation lasts one year, with one foal born at a time. Foals weigh about 55 pounds at birth, and are up and walking within hours. Foals are weaned at 10 months.  p

 p During the 1950s, numbers of these zebras were estimated at 50,000 to 75,000 individuals. In 1992 they were estimated at only about 8,000.  p
