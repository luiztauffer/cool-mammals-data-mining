 p  span style="font-size: 16px;" The plains zebra is mid-sized and thick bodied with relatively short legs. Adults of both sexes stand about 1.4 meters high at the shoulder, are approximately 2.3 meters long, and weigh around 220-322 kg. Males may weigh 10% more than females. They are boldly striped with black or dark muzzles and have an upright short mane. The main colours are black and white but the southern plains zebra displays “shadow” brown stripes between the black and white colourings.  span   p
