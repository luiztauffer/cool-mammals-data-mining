 p Zebras live in family groups of a single stallion with his mares and their offspring. Under threat from predators such as hyenas and lions, zebras bunch together to confuse attackers with a mass of stripes, or run away at speeds of up to 40mph. The stallion guards the rear and will attack predators with hooves and teeth if necessary.  p 
 p Each zebra has a unique pattern of stripes – much like our fingerprints, in fact!  p
