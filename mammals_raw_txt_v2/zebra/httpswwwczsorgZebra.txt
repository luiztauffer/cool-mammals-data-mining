 p 
		Grevy's zebras have large heads, erect manes, and round ears. They have narrow, concentric stripes as well as a thick black line that goes down their spine. These stripes are set very close together and are vertical until the hindquarters begin; the stripes are horizontal down their legs. Their bellies are white, without stripes. Their manes stand straight up and are striped with the white and black colors on their bodies.  p 
 p 
		Grevy's zebras are threatened by land degradation, which reduces the resources available to them. Females may have to travel long distances to find water, which can be fatal to foals who cannot keep up or are malnourished by poor milk (caused by their mother's lack of water). Mares may not go into estrus, either, if their body condition is too poor, which can be a result of reduced resources. They also have to compete with domestic animals at waterholes.  p
