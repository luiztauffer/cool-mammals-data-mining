 p Chapman’s zebras are found in a variety of habitats, from savannah and light woodland to hilly areas and mountain slopes. Zebras live in small family groups consisting of one dominant male (the stallion), up to six females (mares), and their young (foals).  p 
 p Zebras are herbivores and feed mainly on grasses and sedges, although they will also eat fruits, leaves, buds, roots and bark.  p 
 p Female zebras are pregnant for around 12 - 13 months, and usually give birth to a single young. They start to eat grass within a week but are not fully weaned until around 7 to 11 months.  p 
 p These zebras have recently been classed as ‘Near Threatened’ as numbers are believed to have dropped by 25% in just 25 years! Threats include hunting and the loss of migration routes.  p
