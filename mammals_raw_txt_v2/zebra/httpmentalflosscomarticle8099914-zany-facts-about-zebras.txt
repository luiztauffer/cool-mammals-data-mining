 p align="center" style="text-align: left;" Zebras are more than just striped members of the horse family. Some are rugged mountaineers, some have spots instead of stripes, and some of them bark like dogs. Read on to discover these and other bizarre facts about zebras.   p

 p Every zebra has a unique pattern of stripes. And scientists can  a href="http:  www.grevyszebratrust.org stripe-recognition.html" target="_blank" use the patterns like bar codes  a  to identify individuals in a herd and keep track of them over time.  p 
 p Compared to today’s methods, the first efforts to identify zebras by their stripes were pretty low-tech. Hans and Ute Klingel, a husband and wife team, pioneered stripe recognition with Grevy’s zebras back in the 1960s. First, they photographed a bunch of zebras. Then they developed the pictures in a dark room they erected right in the field. Next, they created a card index with coded, hand-written notes on each animal’s pattern. See a few of their cards  a href="http:  www.grevyszebratrust.org stripe-recognition.html" target="_blank" here  a .  p 
 p These days,  a href="http:  www.nbcnews.com id 42500680 ns technology_and_science-science " target="_blank" special software  a  can scan images of zebras and identify individuals by “reading” their stripes like bar codes. It can even compensate for  a href="http:  www.grevyszebratrust.org stripe-recognition.html" target="_blank" changes  a  in posture and weight, including pregnancy.   p 
 p For decades and decades, scientists have wondered why zebras have stripes. One prevailing theory held that the stripes confused predators, making it harder for, say, a lion to pick out an individual zebra from a stampeding herd.   p 
 p Lately, more intriguing theories have emerged. Some scientists think that stripes keep zebras  a href="http:  news.nationalgeographic.com news 2015 01 150113-zebras-stripes-evolution-animals-science-africa " target="_blank" cooler  a . The dark stripes soak up more sunlight than the light ones, and this stirs up eddies of wind that swirl heat away. Other researchers discovered that  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 56069 why-do-zebras-have-stripes" target="_blank" biting flies avoid striped patterns  a . And the two theories might be linked: Biting flies prefer hot temperatures, so they may be less likely to bite a cooler zebra.   p 
 p There are three species of zebra, and many subspecies. They come in different sizes, body shapes, stripe patterns—and, to a certain extent, even colors. The white stripes can verge on cream and the dark stripes can be black or brown. Some  a href="https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Burchell's_zebra# media File:Equus_quagga_burchellii_-_Etosha,_2014.jpg" target="_blank" subspecies  a  have pale, shadowy stripes between the larger dark ones. Plus, there are all sorts of mutations and variations. The occasional zebra has  a href="http:  www.environment.ucla.edu newsroom how-the-zebra-changed-its-stripes-evolution-of-stripe-variation-in-the-plains-zebra " target="_blank" spots  a  and some are  a href="http:  www.animalorphanagekenya.org march-2007 " target="_blank" so pale they're almost entirely white  a !   p 
 p One of the three zebra species, the  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 7960 0" target="_blank" mountain zebra  a , lives mostly in hilly, rocky places in South Africa and nearby Namibia. It has  a href="http:  www.arkive.org mountain-zebra equus-zebra " target="_blank" especially hard, sharp hooves  a  that help it climb and keep its balance in rugged terrain. And while this rugged critter can’t grow a mountain man beard, it does have a bizarre, prominent  a href="https:  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons 1 12 Hartmann_zebra_hobatere_S.jpg" target="_blank" neck flap  a  called a dewlap.  p 
 p  a href="http:  www.arkive.org plains-zebra equus-quagga " target="_blank" Plains zebras  a  are the smallest. They’re also the most abundant—in fact, they’re the most numerous of all the wild members of the horse family. They roam across much of southeastern Africa.   p 
 p Plains zebras come in all sorts of subspecies, and there’s a lot of coat variation between. For example, as you travel  a href="http:  www.environment.ucla.edu newsroom how-the-zebra-changed-its-stripes-evolution-of-stripe-variation-in-the-plains-zebra " target="_blank" farther south  a  across Africa, plains zebras will have fewer stripes on their legs. Nobody’s sure why, but it may have something to do with temperature or populations of those biting flies.   p 
 p Found in Kenya and Ethiopia,  a href="http:  www.arkive.org grevys-zebra equus-grevyi " target="_blank" Grevy’s zebras  a  have a more donkey-like shape, with huge round ears. They’re the largest wild members of the horse family, and can weigh up to 990 lbs. (Yes, domestic horses get much bigger, but that’s because we’ve spent thousands of years breeding them into all sorts of shapes and sizes; some are  a href="http:  www.guinnessworldrecords.com news 2012 9 record-holder-profile-big-jake-worlds-tallest-horse-video-44749 " target="_blank" enormous  a .)   p 
 p These zebras are named after a President of France. In 1882, Emperor of  span A  span  span byssinia (now Ethiopia)   span Menelik II presented one as a gift to French President Jules Grévy. Ever since then, they’ve been named in honor of Grévy.  p 
 p There are plenty of useful field marks for distinguishing the zebra species, but one is to look at the pattern on the rump. Mountain zebras have a  a href="http:  cache3.asset-cache.net gc 519877092-mountain-zebra-rump-stripes-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=sMb1kv07mFiL3v%2BjtCIbkItxEGwYTQ0yHfb%2BNYo8QsCNw8sc0aouhbV4slBRLtOF" target="_blank" “gridiron” pattern  a  of small stripes above their tail. Plains zebras have  a href="http:  www.zoo.org.au sites default files styles zv_carousel_large public Zebra-giraffe-web620.jpg?itok=C3Uewk8Y" target="_blank" broad bands  a  across the rear. Grevy’s zebras have a sort of  a href="https:  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons 7 74 Grevy's_Zebra_Stallion.jpg" target="_blank" triangle pattern  a  on the rump, with lots of small lines near the tail. Once you learn these differences, you’ll tell them apart with ease—just be sure to explain to your safari companions why you’re so fascinated by zebra butts.   p 
 p The  a href="http:  www.equids.org pzebra.php" target="_blank" quagga  a , a remarkable subspecies of the plains zebra, was mostly yellow-brown and  a href="https:  upload.wikimedia.org wikipedia commons a a3 Quagga.jpg" target="_blank" un-striped  a  below its shoulders. Native to South Africa, it was  a href="http:  www.wired.com 2009 08 dayintech_0812 " target="_blank" driven to extinction  a  by European settlers and hunters. The last quagga died at the  a href="http:  www.wired.com 2009 08 dayintech_0812 " target="_blank" Amsterdam Zoo in 1883  a .  p 
 p Incredibly, a group called the  a href="http:  www.quaggaproject.org " target="_blank" Quagga Project  a , based in South Africa, has been working to resurrect this subspecies. They pick plains zebras that look the most quagga-like and breed them together, hoping to awaken any quagga genes that may still be present. The project has drawn  a href="http:  www.cnn.com 2016 01 25 africa quagga-project-zebra-conservation-extinct-south-africa " target="_blank" criticism  a , however: some argue that recreating an animal’s appearance isn’t the same as restoring its unique behavior and ecological role.  p 
 p  a href="http:  www.arkive.org mountain-zebra equus-zebra " target="_blank" Mountain zebras  a  and  a href="http:  www.arkive.org plains-zebra equus-quagga " target="_blank" plains zebras  a  live in small groups consisting of one stallion (male) and a handful of mares (females). You may notice that this ratio is a little askew. Where do the “extra” males go? Stallions that haven’t secured a herd will gather to bro down in roving bachelor bands. Some of those bachelors may try to take over a pre-existing herd, but it's no easy task. First, a bachelor must defeat the lead stallion. Then, he waits for the females to warm up to him—which may take up to three years.  p 
 p And then there’s the Grevy’s zebra. A mature Grevy’s stallion doesn’t seek to command a herd of females—he  a href="http:  www.grevyszebratrust.org about-grevy-zebra.html" target="_blank" stakes out some land  a . Ideally, he claims a territory that has some nice food and water. Then he hunkers down and plays the waiting game. Female Grevy’s zebras are wanderers, and the stallion is hoping that the ladies will visit for some sustenance and perhaps romance. Young Grevy’s males who don’t have territories will buddy up into groups and also wander. Those territorial stallions tolerate their presence—that is, until a receptive female wanders by. Then  a href="http:  www.discovery.com tv-shows africa videos zebra-stallion-picks-fights " target="_blank" things get ugly  a . (Don't click on that link unless you're comfortable with graphic zebra romance.)  p 
 p No, really: don’t. Humans domesticated horses thousands of years ago, modifying their appearance and behavior and turning them into compliant, beloved companions. But zebras were never domesticated. It’s sort of like the difference between a poodle and a wolf. There are several reasons that humans domesticated horses instead of zebras, including a zebra’s ducking reflex.  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com zorsinaround" target="_blank" Watch this video  a  to learn more.  p 
 p Zebras make all sorts of weird sounds. Mountain zebras  a href="https:  louisvillezoo.org animalsandplants hartmanns-mountain-zebra " target="_blank" whinny like a horse  a , Grevy’s zebras  a href="https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=THXbh5VolBY" target="_blank" bray like a donkey  a , and plains zebras  a href="https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=EiAJ5dxC5LI" target="_blank" bark like dogs  a . Alarmed stallions may  a href="http:  animaldiversity.org accounts Equus_zebra #1be1fbc9a22052c11f1a37e16a4a14d8" target="_blank" squeal or snort  a , and happy zebras may push air between their lips when they’re eating.   p 
 p Zebras can breed with other members of the horse family. The offspring come in an amazing variety of semi-striped patterns, and are usually sterile (meaning they can’t have young). Zorses are the offspring of horse stallions and zebra mares. Zedonks are the products of zebra stallions and donkey mares. Zonies come from zebras and ponies. And there are  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 18172 zebroids-beyond-zebra" target="_blank" many more bizarre possibilities  a .   p 
 p Two out of the three zebra species aren’t doing so well. Grevy’s zebras are in the deepest doo-doo: habitat loss, hunting, competition for food and water with domestic grazing animals, and disease have all taken their toll. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 7950 0" target="_blank" labels them endangered  a  and says they’ve “undergone one of the most substantial reductions of range of any African mammal.” There are only about 2000 of these big-eared zebras left.  p 
 p Mountain zebras face similar threats, and are listed as  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 7960 0" target="_blank" Vulnerable  a , which is one rung better than Endangered. There are about 9000 left.   p 
 p Plains zebras, on the other hand, are in pretty okay shape. Despite local declines from habitat loss and hunting, their population is  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 41013 0" target="_blank" fairly stable  a .   p 
 p Preserving zebras is important because they’re amazing, and because they’re food for majestic predators like lions. But also…   p 
 p For pickier grazers such as Thomson’s gazelles and wildebeest, zebras are a huge boon. Those striped heroes have special digestive systems that can quickly process lower-quality forage.  a href="https:  portals.iucn.org library efiles documents 2002-043.pdf" target="_blank" Plains zebras  a  are often the first to enter an un-grazed grassy area. They’ll munch on older, harder, less nutritious plants that other grazers can’t eat. Once the old stuff is cleared out, tender new growth pops up. More selective grazers will then wander in and eat the good stuff.  p 
 p Lincoln the goat may not be housebroken, but she had no problem winning the race for mayor of Fair Haven, Vermont. The new mayor was officially sworn in on Tuesday, March 12, and before signing the oath of office with her hoof print, she marked the occasion by defecating on the town hall floor, the  a href="https:  www.bostonglobe.com metro 2019 03 17 the-goat-mayor-this-vermont-town-sensation KB4dEnSBECQhjT7mmf9e0O story.html" target="_blank"  em Boston Globe  em   a  reports.  p 
 p Prior to getting into politics, Lincoln the droopy-eared Nubian goat lived a simple life. A local family looking for a way to maintain the unruly vegetation on their property had purchased her two years ago when she was 1 year old. At age 3, Lincoln transitioned from munching grass full-time to running for public office.  p 
 p Though Lincoln's win is impressive, her election didn't involve beating any human candidates. Town Manager Joseph Gunter came up with the idea to hold an election for honorary pet mayor of Fair Haven as way to raise money for a new playground. For a $5 fee, local kids were allowed to nominate the pet of their choice to be town mayor. Lincoln bested more than a dozen candidates, including a gerbil named Crystal and a pacifier-sucking dog named  a href="https:  www.burlingtonfreepress.com story news 2019 03 13 lincoln-goat-mayor-fair-haven-vermont 3149928002 " target="_blank" Stella  a , for the position.  p 
 p The stunt didn't raise much money—the town came away with just  a href="https:  www.wcax.com content news Goat-getting-sworn-in-as-mayor-of-Fair-Haven-507057341.html" target="_blank" $100  a  for the playground—but it did earn Fair Haven international attention. In order to go down in history as world's longest-serving animal mayor, Lincoln has to stick around for a while;  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 31231 4-animals-ran-mayor-and-won" target="_self" Stubbs  a  the cat was mayor of Talkeetna, Alaska for  a href="https:  www.theguardian.com us-news 2017 jul 24 stubbs-cat-mayor-alaskan-town-talkeetna-20-years-dies-margarita" target="_blank" 20 years  a .  p

 p If you brought home a new dog or puppy recently and named it Luna, you’re far from the only one. The name, which means  em moon  em  in Latin, is the most popular puppy name for 2019.  p 
 p This analysis of cute canine monikers comes from  a href="https:  trupanion.com " target="_blank" Trupanion  a , a provider of medical insurance for pets. The company looked at its database of 500,000 dogs and crunched the numbers to identify the names that are currently having a moment. (Although some of the names that cracked the top 10 list, like Daisy and Max, have been around for quite some time.)  p 
 p Interestingly, Luna wasn’t always popular. As Trupanion points out, “Looking back 10 years, Luna was barely a blip on the name game chart … not even cracking the list of top 20 names.” Nor did it appear on ​Banfield Pet Hospital's  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 562921 10-most-popular-dog-names-2018" target="_self" list  a  of the 10 most popular dog names of 2018.  p 
 p Often, there's some overlap between popular pet names and  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 545502 camreigh-kayzleigh-parents-invented-more-1000-new-baby-names-last-year" target="_self" baby names  a . Luna was the  a href="https:  www.babycenter.com top-baby-names" target="_blank" 31st  a  most popular baby name for girls in 2018. This is perhaps linked to the popularity of the  em Harry Potter  em  character Luna Lovegood, as well as the publicity the name has received in recent years from celebrities like John Legend and Chrissy Teigen and Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem, as both couples named their daughters Luna.  p
