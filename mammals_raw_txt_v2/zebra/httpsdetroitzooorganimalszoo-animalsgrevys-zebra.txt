Description  strong  br 
Grevy’s zebras are the largest of the three zebra species. They have large, rounded ears, white bellies and defined, black stripes down their spines. They are white with fine, black stripes covering their bodies. They have long, narrow faces with black muzzles. Their thick, erect mane runs from between their ears to the beginning of their backs.  p 
 p All zebras are uniquely striped; no two zebras have the same stripe pattern.  p 
 p The Grevy's zebra is not closely related to the horse but to the wild donkey.  p 
 p In 1882, the Emperor of what is now Ethiopia thought the zebra was so regal that he presented one as a gift to the President of France, Jules Grévy, which is how the species earned its name.  p
