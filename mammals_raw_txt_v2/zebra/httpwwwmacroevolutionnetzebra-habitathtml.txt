Zebra  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net biology-dictionary-h.html#habitat" style="text-decoration:none" title="show definition of habitat" habitat  a  can include open plains, semi-desert, open woodlands, and even mountainous regions. This variation occurs because there are three types of zebra, Burchell's zebra ( em Equus burchelli  em ), Grevy's zebra ( em Equus grevyi  em ), and the mountain zebra ( em Equus zebra  em ).ยน

Grevy's zebra lives in the most  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net biology-dictionary-uz.html#xeric" style="text-decoration:none" title="show definition of xeric" xeric  a  habitat of the three, the sub-desert region of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia between the range of Burchell's zebra to the south, and the African wild ass to the north.  em Equus grevyi  em  can live off of tough desert grasses that are inedible to cattle.

Burchell's zebra is found in a more varied range of habitats, ranging from  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net biology-dictionary-sasi.html#savanna" style="text-decoration:none" title="show definition of savanna" savanna  a , to open woodland and scrub, to grassland. It also can occur in hilly, or even mountainous, country up to an elevation of 4,400 meters. It's much more dependent on the availability of fresh water than is Grevy's zebra.

As its name suggests, the mountain zebra generally occurs in mountainous or hilly regions. Like Burchell's, most of its diet is composed of grass, with the addition of some  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net biology-dictionary-babe.html#browser" style="text-decoration:none" title="show definition of browse" browse  a .

However, since  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net horse-hybrids.html" title="read more about zebra hybrids" hybridization occurs between all the different types of zebra  a  where they come into natural contact, as well as between zebras and horses in southern Africa, and between zebras and wild asses in the northeast of Africa, it is questionable whether the various zebra types should be treated as separate species or as a single varying species.
