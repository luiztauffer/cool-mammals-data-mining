 p Grevy’s zebras have undergone one of the most substantial reductions of range of any African mammal.   p 
 p Habitat loss in an already restricted range is a serious threat to the Grevy’s Zebra's survival.  p 
 p The Grevy's zebra is threatened by the introduction of livestock that compete for grazing land. These zebras are beneficial to other wild grazers because they clear off the tops of coarse grasses that are difficult for other herbivores to digest.  p 
 p Hunting is the primary cause of decline of Grevy’s zebras in Ethiopia. They are primarily hunted for their striking skins but will occasionally be killed for food, and in some regions, medicinal uses continue.  p 
 p Grevy’s zebra may fall prey to lions, cheetahs, hyenas, hunting dogs and leopards.  p
