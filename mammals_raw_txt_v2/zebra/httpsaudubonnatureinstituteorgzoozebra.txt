   INSTRUCTIONS
   The VersaTag code should be placed at the top of the  BODY  section of the HTML page.
   To ensure that the full page loads as a prerequisite for the VersaTag
   being activated (and the working mode is set to synchronous mode), place the tag at the bottom of the page. Note, however, that this may
   skew the data for slow-loading pages, and in general is not recommended.
   If the VersaTag code is configured to run in async mode, place the tag at the bottom of the page before the end of the  BODY   section.

  
   NOTE: You can test if the tags are working correctly before the campaign launches
   as follows:  Browse to http:  bs.serving-sys.com BurstingPipe adServer.bs?cn=at, which is 
   a page that lets you set your local machine to 'testing' mode.  In this mode, when
   visiting a page that includes a VersaTag, a new window will open, showing you
   the tags activated by the VersaTag and the data sent by the VersaTag tag to the Sizmek servers.
