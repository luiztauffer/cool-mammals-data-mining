 p Zebra are closely related to the domesticated horse, sharing a 
              genus ( em Equus  em ) and a common ancestor. They stand nearly 
              five feet at the shoulder, live in small family groups or herds, 
              are sociable herbivores who breed well in public and live in harmony 
              with their mammalian neighbors, like antelopes and wildebeest. They 
              are even strong enough to carry an adult human on their backs.
