 p class="bodytext" Zebras are a part of African Equids, or more commonly, they are members of the horse family. They are broken into three different species. The plain zebra, the Grevy’s zebra, and the mountain zebra are all characterized by their black-and-white stripes. They are said to reach up to four and a half feet in height, eight and a half feet in length and weigh up to 770 pounds. They are social animals that live among other zebras, but they have not been able to be domesticated.  p 
 p class="bodytext" The zebra can survive in various habitats such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains and coastal hills, which allows them to live all over the world. Zebras are herbivores and obtain their nutrients from mostly grasses, but also consume shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves, and bark.  p 
 p class="bodytext" Zebras communicate with each other through high-pitched noises, while their ears portray how they are feeling at any given time. When zebras are in a calm or friendly mood, their ears stand upright. When zebras are frightened, their ears are pushed forward, and when angry, their ears are pulled backward. When zebras inspect an area for predators, their ears stand straight up.  p 
 p class="bodytext" Due to hunting for zebra skin and the destruction of their habitat, the Grevy’s zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered species.  p
