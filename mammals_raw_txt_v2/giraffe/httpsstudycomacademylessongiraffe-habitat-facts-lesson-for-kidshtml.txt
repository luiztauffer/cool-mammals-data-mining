 p You know giraffes for their long necks, but did you know their necks allow them to find food that no one else can get to? Giraffes are  b herbivores  b , or animals that eat only plant life. They especially like to eat acacia, a thorny, shrub-like tree, but they also will eat leaves from tall trees that only they can reach with their long necks. Because giraffes are the tallest animals in the world, they have little competition for sky-high food sources. It would be like having access to an ice cream sundae that only you could reach!   p 
 p In order to get the food they need, giraffes have to live in a habitat that meets certain conditions, such as having tall trees and plenty of space. You might be surprised to learn that although giraffes often eat leaves from tall trees, they do not like to live in most forests. Forests are too crowded with trees. In a congested forest, a giraffe can't see in all directions to spot predators like humans, lions, and crocodiles from far off. So giraffes make their homes in wide open grasslands, or  b savannas  b , which are grassland areas with some trees. Giraffes do inhabit certain forests, but only those that have a lot of open space.   p 
 p Giraffes are native to Africa, particularly the area south of the Sahara Desert. It gets really hot on those dry savannas. Imagine for a moment how awkward it would be for you to drink water from the ground while still standing. Now imagine how awkward that would be if you were a giraffe! That's one reason giraffes don't drink water very often, even in a hot climate. In fact, giraffes can go longer without water than camels can!   p 
 p While giraffes do drink water when it is available, they only drink it once every few days. You would get very thirsty waiting that long to drink, but giraffes can wait because they get a lot of water from the plant life they eat. However, when they do drink water, watch out - they can drink up to twelve gallons at a time.   p

 p Giraffes and their habitats are becoming endangered as the years go by. In Africa, even though it's against the law, hunters prey on giraffes for their meat, skin, and other body parts. These illegal hunters are called  b poachers  b , and they often poach to acquire giraffe parts that are used in African tribal traditions and ceremonies.   p 
 p In addition, the habitat of giraffes is also shrinking because loggers are cutting down trees that giraffes use for food. This reduces the giraffes' food supply. The good news is that some conservation organizations are working to relocate giraffes to new habitats to help them continue to reproduce. These groups are closely monitoring the giraffes' habitats to make sure they don't get corrupted by poachers and loggers.   p 
 p Giraffes are  b herbivores  b  who don't have to drink water very often, and use their long necks to feed themselves on the dry  b savannas  b  where they live.  b Poachers  b  and loggers are harming giraffes and their habitats, but others are trying to help them survive. The giraffes' habitat needs to be conserved to keep them alive.  p
