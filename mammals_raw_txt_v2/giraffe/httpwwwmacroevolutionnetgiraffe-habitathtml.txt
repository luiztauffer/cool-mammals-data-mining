Historically, the giraffe existed throughout most of Africa. Today, however, it occurs naturally only in the  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net biology-dictionary-sasi.html#subsaharan" style="text-decoration:none" title="display definition" sub-Saharan  a  regions of the continent, ranging from southern Mali to Kenya, and south to northern South Africa (see map below). Even where giraffes survive, the populations are far smaller than they used to be. And the herds are smaller, too. Lowek (1999, pp. 1088-1089) notes that when giraffes were more common, “herds of more than 100 individuals were recorded, but most groups now contain 2-10 animals.” He goes on to say that

Giraffes gather around rivers and waterholes during the dry season, but move into open,  a href="http:  www.macroevolution.net biology-dictionary-dadm.html#deciduous" title="display definition" style="text-decoration:none" deciduous  a  woodlands during the rains (Leuthold and Leuthold, 1978). These migrations usually cover about 20-30 km. The movements of giraffes, however, are far less constrained by the availability of water. They can go without water for many weeks, if not months.
