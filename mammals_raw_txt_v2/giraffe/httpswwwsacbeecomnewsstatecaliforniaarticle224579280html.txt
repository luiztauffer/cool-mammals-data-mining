 p dir="ltr" Kumi, a 5-month-old giraffe at the San Diego Zoo, was euthanized last month after he was gored in the stomach, according to zoo officials.  p 
 p dir="ltr" “Keepers found Kumi in his East Africa field habitat in the early morning hours with a gore wound to his belly,” the zoo  a href="https:  www.facebook.com sdzsafaripark photos a.191010764248941 2634094293273897 ?type=3" target="_blank" wrote on Facebook  a  over the weekend. “The injury was assessed and it was determined that it could not be treated.”  p 
 p dir="ltr" Veterinarians made the “difficult decision” to put Kumi down on Dec. 29, the zoo said.  p 
 p dir="ltr" Zookeepers suspect they know what animal gored Kumi: It was “likely” an antelope that lives in the East Africa enclosure with the giraffes.  p

 p dir="ltr" But zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons said that while the wound suggested an antelope was behind the goring, zookeepers lack  a href="https:  fox5sandiego.com 2019 01 15 5-month-old-giraffe-euthanized-after-being-found-with-gore-wound-at-safari-park " target="_blank" definitive proof  a , Fox 5 San Diego reports.  p

 p That said, it’s all a part of what the wildlife would encounter in nature, the zoo said. The exhibit Kumi called home includes a host of other species native to the parts of Africa where a giraffe would roam, guaranteeing they interact with the same animals they would encounter in the wild.  p 
 p “In natural habitats,  a href="https:  www.sandiegouniontribune.com news zoo sd-me-kumi-giraffe-euthanized-safari-park-20190114-story.html" target="_blank" animals are faced with stress  a . They’re eaten by predators, they run into challenges,” Simmons said, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. “We protect them a great deal in human-managed environments. But we do recognize that when you’re working toward conserving a species, you have to provide them with some of the same kinds of things they would normally experience in their natural habitat.”  p 
 p dir="ltr" Kumi was born in the zoo on Aug. 6, 2018, and was a healthy young giraffe until his injury, the Union-Tribune reports.  p 
 p “Animals that live in African plains, particular the big hoofed animals, normally live in multi-species groups,” Simmons said, according to the newspaper.  p 
 p dir="ltr" Interspecies conflicts aren’t the only tension zookeepers have to worry about while tending to animals in captivity. In October, a lioness at the Indianapolis Zoo  a href="https:  www.sacbee.com news nation-world national article220335095.html" target="_blank" suffocated and killed the male lion who fathered three cubs  a  with her years earlier, McClatchy reported.  p 
 p dir="ltr" That incident also came as a surprise.  p 
 p dir="ltr" “We don’t know what the precursor to the fight was,”  a href="https:  www.wibc.com news local-news lion-named-nyack-killed-fight-female-lion-indianapolis-zoo" target="_blank" zoo curator David Hagen said  a , according to WIBC. “They had been together for eight years and during that time that had done really well together.”  p
