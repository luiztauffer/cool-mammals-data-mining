 p style="text-align: justify;"  strong 1)  strong  Giraffes are found in the dry  strong savannas of Africa  strong , where they roam among the open plains and woodlands.  p 
 p  strong 2)  strong  Well known for their long necks, these gentle giants are the world’s tallest living land animals. An adult male can  strong grow to around 5.5m  strong  – that’s taller than  em three  em  adult humans!  p 
 p  strong 3)  strong  A giraffe’s height is helpful for keeping a look out for predators, such as  a href="https:  www.natgeokids.com za discover animals general-animals 10-lion-facts " target="_blank" rel="noopener"  strong lions  strong   a  and  a href="https:  www.natgeokids.com za discover animals general-animals spotted-hyena-facts " target="_blank" rel="noopener"  strong hyenas  strong   a . Their excellent eyesight allows them to spot hungry beasts from far away, too.  p 
 p  strong 4)  strong  Herbivores, giraffes only eat plants. Their favourite grub is the  strong acacia tree  strong , and they use their long necks to reach the leaves and buds in the treetops. Their  strong long tongues   strong (which grow to a whopping 53cm!) also help them pull down leaves growing way up high.  p 
 p  strong 5)  strong  And boy do these guys have an appetite! They spend most of their time eating, and can guzzle up to  strong 45kg of leaves and twigs a day  strong !  p 
 p style="text-align: center;" Did you know that we have a FREE downloadable  a href="https:  www.natgeokids.com za primary-resource giraffe-primary-resource " target="_blank" rel="noopener" giraffe primary resource  a ? Great for teachers, homeschoolers and parents alike!  p 
 p  strong 6)  strong  Whilst they may eat a lot, giraffes don’t drink much water. This is because they get most of their water from their leafy meals, and only need to drink once every few days.  p 
 p  strong 7)  strong  Giraffes are very social animals and roam around in groups. These groups, called  strong towers  strong , typically have around 15 members led by an adult male. The other members are females and young males.  p 
 p  strong 8)  strong  To see who is stronger, males (called  strong bulls)  strong  fight by butting their long necks and heads. This is known as “ strong necking  strong “. These fights aren’t usually dangerous, and end when one bull admits defeat and walks away.  p 
 p  strong 9)  strong  Female giraffes give birth standing up. The result? Newborns are welcomed to the world with a  strong 1.5m drop to the ground  strong !  em Ouch  em ! But these infants are quick to get on their feet – within 30 minutes they are standing, and only hours later they”re able to run with their mothers.  p 
 p  strong 10)   strong In the wild these beautiful creatures live for around 25 years. In captivity they live longer, and have been known to reach 40 years old.  p
