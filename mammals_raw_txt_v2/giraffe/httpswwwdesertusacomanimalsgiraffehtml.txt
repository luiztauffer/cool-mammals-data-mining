 p  Ancient Romans and Greeks thought the giraffe was a mix between a camel
and a leopard - thus the scientific name  em camelopardalis  em .  p 
 p A pair of French biologists wrote in the late 18th century that the giraffe
was “magnificent in appearance, bizarre in form, unique in gait, colossal in
height and inoffensive in character.”   p 
 p  The giraffe is a member of the  em giraffidae  em  family. The only other
animal in this family is the okapi. With large, irregular brownish to black spots
and yellow fur and a very long neck, the giraffe is indeed bizarre in form. The
giraffe is the tallest living animal. A long neck consisting of seven vertebrae
enable the giraffe to reach trees and shrubs that are out of reach of other animals.
Their long 18" tongue and their ability to extend their head vertically gives
them an even longer reach above their towering height. This gives the giraffe
an advantage when it comes to survival.  p 
 p Males are called bulls and females are called cows.  p 
 p Africa, south of the Sahara.   p 
 p The habitat of the giraffe is dry savannah, grasslands or open woodlands.
They will move into wooded areas with denser vegetation in search of food. Acacia
is the main component in the giraffes’ diet. They occasionally eat grasses, and
fruit on trees, but Acacia and Combretum trees are their favorite. Giraffes need
about 75lbs of leaves per day to maintain their body weight. This requires that
they spend at least 12 hours a day grazing or browsing for food. The trees the
giraffe eat are often far apart and their herds tend to wander in a loose formation
when foraging.   p 
 p The giraffe lives in very dry areas and will drink large quantities of water
when they can to survive. They tend to drink water every couple of days and consume
an average of 10 gallons on days that they drink. They  also  obtain
water through their diet of Acacia leaves and foilage, enabling them to survive
longer in  dry areas where water is sometimes scarce.   p 
 p  The only viable predator an adult giraffe has is the lion. Giraffes
have very powerful legs and they use their legs to defend themselves. A strategic
kick by a giraffe to the skull of a lion can kill it. Young giraffes have more
predators due to their smaller size. Lions, hyenas and leopards often prey on
 giraffe calves. Approximately one fourth of all giraffe calves survive their
first year of life.  p 
 p The giraffe is not a territorial creature. They live in herds that are open
with no obvious leader. The social behavior of giraffes is very informal and
the individuals in the herds are often changing. Their need to spend a large
portion of their day foraging for food makes them more independent than most
herd animals.  p 
 p Females tend  to associate
with other females when they have calf groups. The calves will move and play
with each other, forming durable peer groups. The advantage of the mother-calf
groups is substantial protection from predators for the young. Males will stay
with their maternal herd until around the age of 3, when they may move to another
herd consisting of bachelors. Sexual maturity occurs around the age of 3 or 4,
though males seldom successfully breed until the age 8 or older.  p 
 p Males start competing to mate at the age of 7. Older bulls rarely fight
about mating rights as  their rank is established in the herd. Males may build
dominance over other males by “necking”, a process of rubbing and entwining their
necks and throwing their heavy heads at one another. This behavior is described
as having a rhythmical grace due to the great length of the giraffes' necks.
Though  blows can be heard from quite a distance, rarely is a giraffe injured
this way. The males have regular contests to prove their strength and rank. When
males are part of the bachelor herd they often fight using their horns, neck
and heads. The stronger bull wins and achieves higher rank in the herd.   p 
 p  A cow can conceive when she is 4 years old. Gestation ranges from 14 to 14.5
months. There is usually a break of about 1 to 1.5 years between calves. A cow
returns to the same area each time she gives birth to a calf. The newborn calf
lies out for a good part of the day and most of the night during the first 5
to 7 days. The cow guards her calf, protecting it from predators. The cow stays
close to her calf, but will leave it in a créche, a group of young calves guarded
by one or more cows, when she needs to find water or forage for food.   p 
 p Calves are approximately 6' tall when born and they can grow as much as 1'
per day. When the calves reach 2 months of age they are eating leaves, and they
near independence by 6 months of age. The typical lifespan of a giraffe is approximately
20 to 25 years.   p 
 p  Giraffes are normally silent and don’t make much vocal noise. The calves
make a bleat sound and mewing call, the cows will call their young with a bellowing
sound and the bulls may cough to send out a message to other giraffes. Some have
made whistling sounds, but for the most part these giants are silent.   p 
 p  A giraffe has two gaits: walking and galloping. When walking the right legs
move together and the left legs together. When galloping, the giraffe uses its
front legs together and its back legs together. The walk has an ambling rhythm
with the neck working in synchronicity to keep the body in balance.  p
