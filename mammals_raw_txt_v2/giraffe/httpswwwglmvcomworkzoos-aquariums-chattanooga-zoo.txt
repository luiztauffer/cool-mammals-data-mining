 p Chattanooga Zoo wanted to take their zoo to the next level with a new flagship animal habitat that could really provide a narrative to visitors, so our Zoo team is planning a new, highly visible giraffe habitat and a complementary lion habitat to tell guests a story about life on the savannah. Revenue-generating concepts built into the project include rental venues and giraffe feeding opportunities.  p 
 p Long vistas and large habitats will be the first impressions had by guests visiting Chattanooga Zoo. These new giraffe and lion habitats, the products of a comprehensive master plan created by GLMV Zoos and Zoo Advisors, will enable the zoo to transform itself into a self-sustaining regional destination.  p 
 p If our portfolio speaks to you, please get in touch. Think of what we could create together.  p

 p Few things are more important than making a good first impression, so Naples Zoo enlisted us to design a new entry that would enhance their visitors’ experiences before they even step through the gate. It includes expanded member services, gift shop, new education facility, and native animal habitats American alligator and flamingo.  p 
 p Immersive, experiential design is at the heart of our Zoo studio, and this project encompass those design characteristics in a big way. A first-of-its-kind habitat, Elephants of the Zambezi River Valley will allow guests to be completely surrounded by up to 7 African elephants, both on land, in a pavilion at the heart of the habitat, and on water, in a river boat ride feature.  p
