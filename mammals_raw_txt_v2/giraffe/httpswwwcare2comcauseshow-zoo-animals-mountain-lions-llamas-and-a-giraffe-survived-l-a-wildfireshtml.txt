 p Devastating  a href="https:  www.care2.com causes how-to-help-california-wildfire-survivors.html" target="_blank" wildfires  a  in Los Angeles have burned more than 97,000 acres, forcing thousands of human and animal residents to evacuate.¬†Here‚Äôs how some captive and wild animals survived this disaster.  p 
 p When a brush fire in Griffith Park burned perilously close to the  a href="https:  www.care2.com causes well-being-of-l-a-zoos-billy-the-elephant-could-be-evaluated-by-independent-experts.html" target="_blank" Los Angeles Zoo  a  on Nov. 9,  a href="https:  losangeles.cbslocal.com 2018 11 09 brush-fire-sparks-behind-la-zoo-in-griffith-park " target="_blank" the staff evacuated some animals  a , including the birds featured in its ‚ÄúWorld of Birds‚Äù show¬†and some small primates. The 133-acre zoo keeps 1,400 animals in captivity.  p 
 p ‚ÄúWe turned on sprinklers &amp; began hosing the hillside,‚Äù the zoo  a href="https:  twitter.com LAZoo status 1060966398208307200" target="_blank" tweeted  a . ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt appear the smoke is causing issues for animals but staff is monitoring conditions.‚Äù Later that day, the zoo posted an update on its  a href="https:  www.facebook.com LAZoo posts 10161033846340273" target="_blank" Facebook page  a  saying the fire did not enter the zoo grounds.  p 
 p ‚ÄúNo animals or plant life within zoo grounds were harmed,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúThe animals that were relocated have been safely moved back to their habitats and are doing well.‚Äù  p 
 p All zoos¬†that the  a href="https:  www.aza.org " target="_blank" Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums  a  (AZA) accredits, including the Los Angeles Zoo,  a href="https:  www.care2.com causes what-happens-to-zoo-animals-when-a-natural-disaster-approaches.html" target="_blank" must have a risk management plan in place  a  for the animals. The AZA also¬†requires them to perform at least four preparedness drills annually for emergencies like wildfires and other disasters.  p

 p Mountain lions that make their homes in the Santa Monica Mountains are already struggling to survive. They must risk  a href="https:  www.care2.com causes famous-mountain-lion-who-crossed-l-a-freeway-twice-found-dead.html" target="_blank" crossing busy freeways  a  to leave their limited habitat, and are plagued by health problems caused by incest and the  a href="https:  www.care2.com causes did-rat-poison-kill-a-famous-l-a-mountain-lion.html" target="_blank" ingestion of rodenticides  a . And now the so-called Woolsey Fire that spread through these mountains from the San Fernando Valley to Malibu has decimated their habitat. It‚Äôs sad and shocking that the vast majority ‚Äì 83 percent ‚Äì of federal parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains has  a href="http:  www.latimes.com local california la-me-california-fires-woolsey-hill-camp-in-stunning-loss-83-of-santa-monica-1542135847-htmlstory.html" target="_blank" burned  a . The good news is that as of Nov. 14, 11 of 13 mountain lions in the area that are equipped with GPS collars are alive and moving, according to social media posts from the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The most famous L.A. mountain lion,  a href="https:  www.care2.com causes the-cat-that-changed-america-spotlights-famous-mountain-lion-p-22.html" target="_blank" P-22  a , was¬†among the ones¬†they haven‚Äôt heard from, but  a href="https:  abc7.com " target="_blank" KABC  a  reported the happy news on its 11 pm newscast that he survived the fire.   p 
 p Of the 13 mountain lions with working radio collars in &amp; around the Santa Monica Mountains, we can confirm with GPS locations &amp; movement data that 8 of those appear to be alive and moving. There are 5 other lions (P-22, P-42, P-47, P-54, P-74) that we‚Äôre unsure about.. üì∑: P-42  a href="https:  t.co nZgAefdcqB" pic.twitter.com nZgAefdcqB  a  ‚Äî Santa Monica Mtns (@SantaMonicaMtns)  a href="https:  twitter.com SantaMonicaMtns status 1062131743849820160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" November 12, 2018  a   p 
 p In Agoura Hills, the area surrounding the 101 freeway where a¬† a href="https:  www.care2.com causes victory-land-purchased-for-future-l-a-wildlife-corridor.html" target="_blank" wildlife crossing  a  is planned also  a href="https:  www.dailynews.com 2018 11 13 woolsey-fire-scorches-mountain-lion-bobcat-habitats-in-its-path-across-the-santa-mountain-mountains " target="_blank" burned  a , which should be more impetus to build that bridge ASAP to help these animals escape.  p 
 p In a decision that has sparked outrage, Malibu Wine Safaris, which keeps over 100 animals in captivity including camels, water buffalo, zebras and a giraffe named Stanley, decided to leave the animals to fend for themselves in a pasture as the Woolsey Fire approached.  p 
 p The fire destroyed what the tourist attraction referred to in social media posts as ‚Äúa considerable portion‚Äù of its barns and facilities ‚Äì and ‚Äúa small number of animals‚Äù were missing. Unlike the Los Angeles Zoo, Malibu Wine Safaris¬† a href="https:  www.aza.org current-accreditation-list#M" target="_blank" is not accredited by the AZA  a  and is not required to have evacuation plans.  p 
 p ‚ÄúWe have to determine whether we shelter in place or whether we risk loading into a trailer,‚Äù Dakota Semler, the owner of Malibu Wine Safaris, told  a href="https:  abc7.com pets-animals stanley-the-giraffe-was-not-evacuated-during-woolsey-fire 4677480 " target="_blank" KABC  a . ‚ÄúAnd particularly with exotics when you have events like this, it can get out of hand quickly and they can go into shock, and in many cases you have risk of hurting them.‚Äù  p 
 p So why risk hurting exotic animals by keeping them in captivity in a fire zone from which they can‚Äôt be quickly evacuated? Fortunately, Stanley the giraffe was among the animals that survived. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs upsetting,‚Äù his veterinarian, Jennifer Conrad, told KABC. ‚ÄúBut the truth is that he‚Äôs OK.‚Äù  p 
 p Rescued horses, llamas and alpacas that provide therapeutic interaction to disadvantaged children and families needed some help of their own when the Woolsey Fire burned close to their home at the  a href="https:  www.bigheartranch.com " target="_blank" Big Heart Ranch  a  in Malibu. They were  a href="https:  people.com pets alpacas-find-refuge-on-zuma-beach-california-wildfires " target="_blank" transported to Zuma Beach  a  to be in close proximity to the safety of the water.  p 
 p Two alpacas and a miniature horse that were tied to a lifeguard station were thought to have gone missing, but fortunately, according to an update on Big Heart Ranch‚Äôs  a href="https:  www.instagram.com p BqCIJ2gAN9V " target="_blank" Instagram  a , they had been taken by volunteers about 35 miles away to Simi Valley, where they were safe and sound.  p 
 p Another animal evacuated to a Malibu beach ‚Äî but without human assistance. Perhaps one of the most stunning photos of wildlife taken during the fire is that of a displaced owl far from its home, sitting¬†alone on the sand.  p
