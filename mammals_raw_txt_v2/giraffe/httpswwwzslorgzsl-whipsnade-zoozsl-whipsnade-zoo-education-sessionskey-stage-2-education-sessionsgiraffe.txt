 p In  em  strong Giraffe Behaviour Study  strong   em  pupils will work scientifically to collect real data on our herd of giraffes. At Giraffe Heights, students will work in groups and come face to face with our herd of giants to collect behavioural data using ethograms. The students will then use this data to create behaviour bar charts and to compare behaviours between different age groups in the herd. Group discussions will then allow students to elaborate on how this data could be used for the conservation of the species in the wild.  p
