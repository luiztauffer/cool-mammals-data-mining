 p tl;dr: So sorry you can’t access DoSomething at the moment! The EU has rolled out new laws to protect your privacy, and we
                        want to make sure we’re following those laws so we can serve you best. We aim to open up traffic to everyone in GDPR-affected 
                        countries by summer 2019.  p 
 p On May 25, 2018 the  a href="https:  www.eugdpr.org eugdpr.org.html" title="General Data Production Regulation" General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  a  goes into effect in the EU. This legislation sounds super boring,
                        but it’s actually really important to protect your privacy and information. DoSomething is working to comply with these new laws.  p 
 p The annoying part is that it means you can't access DoSomething.org until we make updates to comply with the GDPR. The good
                        news is, once we make updates, you’ll be able to use the site just like you did before! Ah, the good ol’ days....  p
