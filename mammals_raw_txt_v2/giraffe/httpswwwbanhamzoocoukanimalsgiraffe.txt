 p Giraffe are found on the dry savannahs of Africa south of the Sahara.  p 
 p Giraffes are browsers mainly feeding on Acacia trees. Giraffes drink regularly when water is available, but can go for long periods without drinking.  p 
 p After a pregnancy of around 14 to 15 months, a single calf is born. They are 6 feet (1.8m) tall and able to walk within one  hour of birth.  p 
 p Giraffe have recently been classed as ‘Vulnerable’, as their wild population has dropped by up to 40% in just 30 years. Habitat loss and degradation are major threats, along with hunting for their meat and hide.  Thankfully many giraffe do occur in protected areas and there is a successful captive breeding programme.  p
