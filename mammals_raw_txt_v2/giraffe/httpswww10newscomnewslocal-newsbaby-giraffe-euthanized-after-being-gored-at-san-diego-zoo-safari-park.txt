 p SAN DIEGO (KGTV) - A baby giraffe at the Safari Park had to be euthanized after suffering a gore wound to its stomach, and San Diego Zoo officials believe the injury was likely caused by an antelope.  p 
 p Over the weekend, the zoo announced that five-month-old Kumi was euthanized on Dec. 29, 2018, due to a gore wound that park officials determined could not be treated.  p 
 p Because of the severity of Kumi’s injury, officials said, “The Safari Park veterinary staff made the difficult decision to euthanize the young giraffe.”  p 
 p Zoo officials said Kumi’s fatal injury was likely caused by an antelope that occupied the same East Africa field habitat.  p 
 p According to officials, “The Safari Park houses numerous species together that would live together in their native habitats, where inter-species encounters also can happen.”  p 
 p A zoo spokesperson told 10News the death was a rare occurence and said it would not be changing its animal habitats.  p
