 p class="text-align-center" Giraffes are the tallest mammals on earth — their legs alone are taller than most people. When you visit the Calgary Zoo’s giraffes, be prepared to look up. Way up!  p 
 p At the Calgary Zoo, we’re passionate about wildlife conservation. Your donations and membership costs can go a long way towards helping us fund our efforts.  p 
 p class="text-align-center" Masai giraffes are found in Kenya and Tanzania, while the reticulated giraffes live in Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia. They like to roam in small groups and make their homes in woodlands and dry, open acacia savannahs.  p 
 p Giraffe legs can pack a real punch. Full-grown giraffes can kick hard enough to break a lion’s skull or spine.  p
