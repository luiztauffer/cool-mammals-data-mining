Giraffes are found in savannas, grasslands, or open woodlands. Because they only occasionally drink, giraffes can be found away from a water source.

 p audience="advanced intermediate"  span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species" Giraffa camelopardalis  span  is the world’s tallest mammal. Male giraffes (bulls) stand a total of 5.7 m from the ground to their horns: 3.3 m at the shoulders with a long neck of 2.4 m. Female giraffes (cows) are 0.7 to 1 m shorter than bulls.  Bulls weigh up to 1,930 kg, while cows can weigh up to 1,180 kg.  At birth, giraffe calves are 2 m tall from the ground to the shoulders.  Newborn giraffes weigh 50 to 55 kg.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Both male and female giraffes have a spotted coat.  The pattern of the coat varies and is an aide for camouflage with the different habitats. The nine giraffe subspecies have various skin patterns.  The patches on a giraffe coat can be small, medium, or large in size.  Giraffe coats are sharp-edged or fuzzy-edged; small, medium, or large; or yellow to black in color.  The skin pattern for an individual giraffe is constant throughout the giraffe’s life.  With the changing of season and health, the coat color may be altered.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#646efc683f0515e198e9455f687a2e8b" class="citation" "Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia", 2003  a )  span   p

Giraffe necks contain 7 elongated vertebrae. Giraffes have a steeply sloping back from the shoulders to the rump. Their tails are thin and long, measuring about 76 to 101 cm in length. A black tuft at the end of the tail whisks away flies and other flying insects.  Giraffe horns, called ossicones, are bone protuberances covered with skin and fur.  Female giraffe horns are thin and tufted; male giraffe horns are thick but the hair is smoothed by sparring.  A medium-sized horn is common in both male and females; while males can grow a second pair behind the first pair of horns. The eyes are very large and their 45 cm long black tongue grasps prickly food from the very tops of trees.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#f209fbf1a2560324a7e8e16a5c793565" class="citation" Burnie and Wilson, 2001  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Giraffes are polgynous. Bulls carefully guard an estrous female from other male giraffes. Courtship starts when a bull approaches a cow to perform a urine test, smelling the urine with a pronounced lip curl, a behavior referred to as flehmen.  The bull will then proceed to rub his head near the rump of the female and rest it on her back.  Male giraffes lick the tail of the female and lift his foreleg. If receptive, the female giraffe will circle the male, hold her tail out, and take on a mating position, after which copulation occurs.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#646efc683f0515e198e9455f687a2e8b" class="citation" "Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia", 2003  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" For  span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species" Giraffa camelopardalis  span , conception occurs in the rainy season, with birth occurring in the dry months. Most giraffe births take place from May to August.  Female giraffes breed every 20 to 30 months. The gestation period is about 457 days. Mother giraffes give birth standing up or walking. The giraffe calf drops 2 m to the ground. Most often a single calf is born; twins are uncommon but do occur.  Newborn calves get to their feet and begin suckling fifteen minutes after birth.  The weaning period for female calves is 12 to 16 months; the weaning period for males is 12 to 14 months.  The independence period varies between bulls and cows. Cows tend to stay within the herd. However, bulls tend to become solitary until they find or obtain their own herd and become the dominant male. Female giraffes reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age but do not breed for at least another year.  At age 4 to 5 years, male giraffe become sexually mature; however, it is not until seven years of age when they start to breed.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#f169c05b5cf91eb9fd9bf8adaa695940" class="citation" "Encyclopedia of Mammals", 1997  a ;  a href="#646efc683f0515e198e9455f687a2e8b" class="citation" "Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia", 2003  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" After three to four weeks, mother giraffes steer their young calves into crèche groups.  The crèche group allows mother giraffes to wander further away from the young calf to feed or drink.  The mother giraffes take turns watching over all the youngsters in the crèche group.  Now the mother giraffe can drift as far as 200 m from her calf.

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Giraffes feed and drink during the morning and evening. Giraffes rest at night while standing up. When resting, the head lies on a hind leg, with the neck forming an impressive arch. Giraffes sleep standing up but can occasionally lie down. Giraffes that are resting lightly remain in a fully upright position, with half-closed eyes, and ears continuing to twitch.  During the hot midday, giraffes usually chews their cud. Cud-chewing can take place during any part of the day.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#bfe55ba624faa0f1100089ac1f5a4f3e" class="citation" "Walker's Mammals of the World", 1999  a ;  a href="#f209fbf1a2560324a7e8e16a5c793565" class="citation" Burnie and Wilson, 2001  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Adult male giraffes establish dominance hierarchies by sparring. Sparring involves two individuals standing stiff-legged and parallel. The males march in step with one another with their necks horizontal and looking forward. They rub and intertwine their necks and heads, then lean against each other to evaluate their opponent’s strength. "Necking" occurs when two giraffes stand alongside each other and swing their heads at the other giraffe.  They aim their horns at their opponent’s rump, flanks, or neck. A hard enough blow can knock down or injure an opponent.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#646efc683f0515e198e9455f687a2e8b" class="citation" "Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia", 2003  a )  span   p

Giraffes communicate with one another by infrasonic sound. They do, at times, vocalize to one another by grunts or whistle-like cries. Some other communication sounds for giraffes are moaning, snoring, hissing, and flutelike sounds. When alarmed, a giraffe grunts or snorts to warn neighboring giraffes of the danger. Mother giraffes can whistle to their young calves. Also, cows search for their lost young by making bellowing calls.  The calves return their mother’s calls by bleating or mewing.  While courting an estrous cow, male giraffes may cough raucously.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#646efc683f0515e198e9455f687a2e8b" class="citation" "Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia", 2003  a ;  a href="#bfe55ba624faa0f1100089ac1f5a4f3e" class="citation" "Walker's Mammals of the World", 1999  a ;  a href="#bc3dd88e3135074efd3c398030d189f4" class="citation" Duplaix and Simon, 1976  a ;  a href="#e29f623f57967aefbbf0d1c6d2830f54" class="citation" Sanderson, 1982  a )  span   p

Giraffe populations remain common in east and southern Africa but have drastically fallen in west Africa. In Niger, conservation of giraffes has been made a priority.  In other places where large mammals have disappeared, giraffes have survived.  Their survival could be because their height diminishes competition with domestic mammals.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#f169c05b5cf91eb9fd9bf8adaa695940" class="citation" "Encyclopedia of Mammals", 1997  a )  span   p
