 p The tallest animal on the ground, giraffes can reach up to 19 feet in height. Females are slightly shorter than males, topping out at 16 feet, but both genders display brown, patterned coats. The giraffe's front legs are longer than the back legs, giving the body as a whole a sloping appearance. Both male and female giraffes display tufted horns on the top of the head, although the males' skull develops layers of bony growths as it ages.  p 
 p Giraffes can be found throughout sub-Saharan Africa.  p 
 p Common. Lincoln Park Zoo participates in the Reticulated and Rothschild Giraffe Species Survival Plan®, a shared management effort by institutions throughout the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.  p 
 p This herbivorous species prefers open woodlands, plains and savannas.  p 
 p Giraffes use their extremely long (up to 18 inches), manipulative tongues to gather leaves in the wild. The tongue is flexible enough to pluck preferred acacia leaves while avoiding the acacia tree's thorns.  p 
 p Giraffes gather in herds of 2-40 individuals. These groupings are fluid, with members frequently coming and going. Males will compete for access to fertile females through “necking,” a behavior where two males entwine their necks and wrestle to determine which is stronger. Females give birth after 14-15 months of gestation, and offspring can measure six feet at birth.  p
