                     br 
                    Giraffes are the tallest of all land living animals. They have a body length between 3.8 and 4.7 m (9.75 - 15 ft), a tail length between 78 and 100 cms (31 - 39 inches), a shoulder height between 4 and 4.7 m (13.1 - 15.4 ft) and they weigh between 0.6 and 1.9 tonnes (0.5 - 2 tons). br 
                     br 
                    Giraffes have long legs, a sloping back and an extremely long neck. They have a long muzzle, medium sized ears and large eyes. On the top of their head they have bony horns called ossicones, especially the adult males, which makes their total height to the top of their horn tips between 4.7 and 5.3 m (15.4 - 17.4 ft) and for females 3.9 - 4.5 m (12.8 - 14.8 ft). br 
                     br 
                    Their coat is short and sandy coloured with various shaped patches coloured different shades of brown. Their mane is short and it stands upright and they have a dark tassel of hair at the tip of their tail. br 
                     br 
                    Giraffes have long, blue black  a href=".. .. glossary prehensile.html" prehensile  a  tongues which can be extended more than 45 cms (18 inches) and they use them for grasping food. They also have unique 2 or 3 lobed  a href=".. .. glossary canine_tooth.html" canine teeth  a  which can be used like a comb to strip leaves from branches. br 
                     br 
                    The heart of a Giraffe can weigh up to 10 Kgs (22 lbs) and be approximately 61 cms (2 ft) long. It has to generate double the normal blood pressure for an average large mammal in order to maintain blood flow to the brain. In the upper neck Giraffes have a complex pressure regulation system that prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the Giraffe lowers its head to drink.  br 
                     br 
                    Male Giraffes often engage in a ritual called "necking". This is where they both swing their neck into each other. This can be used as a form of combat or in an affectionate manner. br

                     b Habitat  b  br 
                     br 
                    Giraffes are found in Africa but are becoming increasingly rare in the west. They live on open grasslands that are scattered with trees.  br 
                     br 
                    Giraffes live in loose herds of up to 20 individuals which change daily and these herds mainly consist of females and occasionally some younger males. Mature males often live solitary lifestyles roaming around in search of breeding females. br 
                     br 
                    A Giraffes  a href=".. .. glossary home_range.html" home range  a  averages at approximately 160 Kms (99 miles) and males are non-territorial, although a dominance hierarchy is determined by a ritualized fight called "necking". br 
                     br 
                     b Diet  b  br 
                     br 
                    Giraffes feed mainly from acacia and commiphora (myrrh) trees. Because of their height they easily pluck the leaves from the tops of these tall trees. br 
                     br 
                    A Giraffe can eat up to 63 Kgs (140 lbs) of leaves and twigs per day. br 
                     br 
                     b Breeding  b  br 
                     br 
                    After a  a href=".. .. glossary gestation_period.html" gestation period  a  of approximately 457 days, 1 calf is born (2 calves are rare). Birthing usually occurs in the dry season and the mother generally gives birth standing up. br 
                     br 
                    New born calves weigh up to 70 Kgs (155 lbs) and they stand at 1.8 - 2m (5.9 - 6.6 ft) tall. Within a few hours of being born they can run around, however for the first two weeks they spend most of their time lying down being guarded by their mother. br 
                     br 
                    After that they spend the next 4 - 5 months with other calves in nursery groups called creches. This enables the mother to go and forage while the calves rest and socialize. br 
                     br 
                    Young Giraffes are  a href=".. .. glossary weaning.html" weaned  a  at 13 months and they reach sexual maturity between 4 and 5 years of age, although it is unlikely that males will get to mate until the are over 8 years old. br 
                     br 
                     b Predators  b   br 
                     br 
                    Adult Giraffes are too large to be attacked by most  a href=".. .. glossary predator.html" predators  a  but the main predators of young Giraffes are  a href=".. carnivores lion.html" lions  a ,  a href=".. carnivores leopard.html" leopards  a ,  a href=".. carnivores dog_african_wild.html" african wild dogs  a  and hyenas. br 
                     br 
                    Only 25 - 50% of Giraffe calves reach adulthood, the rest being victims of predators. br 
                     br
