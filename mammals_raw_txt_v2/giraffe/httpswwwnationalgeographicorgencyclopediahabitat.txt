 p A  a class="tipHelp" habitat  a  is a place where an  a class="tipHelp" organism  a  makes its home. A habitat meets all the environmental conditions an organism needs to survive. For an  a class="tipHelp" animal  a , that means everything it needs to find and gather  a class="tipHelp" food  a , select a mate, and successfully  a class="tipHelp" reproduce  a .  br  br For a  a class="tipHelp" plant  a , a good habitat must provide the right combination of light, air, water, and  a class="tipHelp" soil  a . For example, the  a class="tipHelp" prickly pear cactus  a , which is adapted for sandy soil, dry  a class="tipHelp" climate  a s, and bright sunlight, grows well in  a class="tipHelp" desert  a  areas like the Sonoran Desert in northwest Mexico. It would not  a class="tipHelp" thrive  a  in wet, cool areas with a large amount of  a class="tipHelp" overcast  a  (shady) weather, like the U.S. states of Oregon or Washington.  br  br The main  a class="tipHelp" component  a s of a habitat are  a class="tipHelp" shelter  a , water, food, and  a class="tipHelp" space  a . A habitat is said to have a suitable ar a class="tipHelp" range  a ment when it has the correct amount of all of these. Sometimes, a habitat can meet some components of a  a class="tipHelp" suitable arrangement  a , but not all.  br  br For example, a habitat for a  a class="tipHelp" puma  a  could have the right amount of food (deer, porcupine, rabbits, and rodents), water (a  a class="tipHelp" lake  a , river, or  a class="tipHelp" spring  a ), and shelter ( a class="tipHelp" tree  a s or dens on the  a class="tipHelp" forest  a  floor). The puma habitat would not have a suitable arrangement, however, if it lacks enough space for this large  a class="tipHelp" predator   a to  a class="tipHelp" establish  a  its own  a class="tipHelp" territory  a . An animal might lose this component of habitat—space—when humans start building homes and businesses, pushing an animal into an area too small for it to survive.  p 
 p  strong Space   strong  br  br The amount of space an organism needs to thrive varies widely from species to species. For example, the common  a class="tipHelp" carpenter ant  a  needs only a few square inches for an entire  a class="tipHelp" colony  a  to develop tunnels, find food, and complete all the activities it needs to survive. In contrast,  a class="tipHelp" cougar  a s are very  a class="tipHelp" solitary  a ,  a class="tipHelp" territorial  a  animals that need a large amount of space. Cougars can cover 455 square kilometers (175 square miles) of land to  a class="tipHelp" hunt  a  and find a mate. A cougar could not survive in the same amount of space that a carpenter ant needs. br  br Plants need space, too. Coast redwood trees, like the ones in Redwood National Park in the U.S. state of California, can reach more than 4.5 meters (15 feet) in diameter and 106 meters (350 feet) in height. A tree that  a class="tipHelp" massive  a  would not have enough space to grow and thrive in a  a class="tipHelp" typical  a  community  a class="tipHelp" park  a  or  a class="tipHelp" yard  a . br  br Space is not the same as range; the range of an animal is the part of the world it inhabits.  a class="tipHelp" Grassland  a , for example, is the habitat of the  a class="tipHelp" giraffe  a , but the animal’s range is central, eastern, and southern Africa. !-- pagebreak --  br  br  strong Food  strong  br  br The availability of food is a  a class="tipHelp" crucial  a  part of a habitat’s suitable arrangement. For example, in the northern part of the U.S. state of Minnesota,  a class="tipHelp" black bear  a s eat mostly plants, like clover, dandelions, and blueberries. If there were a  a class="tipHelp" drought  a , plants would become  a class="tipHelp" scarce  a . Even though the habitat would still have space (large forest), shelter ( a class="tipHelp" cave  a s, forest floor), water (streams and lakes), and some food, it wouldn’t have enough to eat. It would no longer be a suitable arrangement.  br  br Too much food can also disrupt a habitat. Algae is a  a class="tipHelp" microscopic  a   a class="tipHelp" aquatic  a  organism that makes its own food through the process of  a class="tipHelp" photosynthesis  a . Nutrients like phosphorous contribute to the spread of  a class="tipHelp" algae  a . When a  a class="tipHelp" freshwater  a  habitat has a sharp increase in phosphorous, algae “blooms,” or reproduces quickly. Algae also dies very quickly, and the  a class="tipHelp" decay  a ing algae produces an  a class="tipHelp" algal bloom  a . The algal bloom can  a class="tipHelp" discolor  a  the water, turning it green, red, or brown. Algal blooms can also  a class="tipHelp" absorb  a   a class="tipHelp" oxygen  a  from the water,  a class="tipHelp" destroy  a ing the habitat of organisms like fish and plants.  a class="tipHelp" Excess  a   a class="tipHelp" nutrient  a s for algae can destroy the habitat’s  a class="tipHelp" food chain  a . br  br  strong Water  strong  br  br Water is essential to all forms of life. Every habitat must have some form of a water supply. Some organisms need a lot of water, while others need very little. For example,  a class="tipHelp" dromedary camel  a s are known for their ability to carry goods and people for long distances without needing much water. Dromedary camels, which have one hump, can travel 161 kilometers (100 miles) without a drink of water. Even with very little access to water in a hot, dry climate, dromedary camels have a suitable arrangement in northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. br  br Cattails, on the other hand, are plants that grow best in wet areas, like  a class="tipHelp" marsh  a es and  a class="tipHelp" swamp  a s.  a class="tipHelp" Dense  a  colonies of these tall, spiky plants grow directly in the  a class="tipHelp" mud  a  beneath lakes, stream banks, and even  a class="tipHelp" neighborhood  a   a class="tipHelp" pond  a s. A  a class="tipHelp" cattail  a  habitat’s suitable arrangement depends on water. Imagine a pond at the bottom of a dirt-covered  a class="tipHelp" cliff  a . If enough loose dirt slid down into the pond, it could fill up the pond and absorb the water, not leaving enough for the cattails to grow.  br  br  strong Shelter  strong  br  br An organism’s shelter protects it from predators and weather. Shelter also provides a space for eating, sleeping, hunting, and raising a family. Shelters come in many forms. A single tree, for example, can provide sheltered habitats for many different organisms. For a  a class="tipHelp" caterpillar  a , shelter might be the underside of a leaf. For a  a class="tipHelp" mushroom  a   a class="tipHelp" fungus  a , shelter might be the cool,  a class="tipHelp" damp  a  area near tree  a class="tipHelp" root  a s. For a  a class="tipHelp" bald eagle  a , shelter may be a high  a class="tipHelp" perch  a  to make a nest and watch for food.  p
