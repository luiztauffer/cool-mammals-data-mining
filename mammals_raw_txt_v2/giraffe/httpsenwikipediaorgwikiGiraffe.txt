Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the  a href=" wiki Mitochondrial_DNA" title="Mitochondrial DNA" mitochondrial  a  and  a href=" wiki Nuclear_DNA" title="Nuclear DNA" nuclear DNA  a , as well as morphological measurements of  i Giraffa,  i  but the  a href=" wiki International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature" International Union for Conservation of Nature  a  currently recognises only one species,  i Giraffa camelopardalis  i , the  a href=" wiki Type_species" title="Type species" type species  a , with nine subspecies. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. 
  p 
 p The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like  a href=" wiki Ossicone" title="Ossicone" ossicones  a , and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the  a href=" wiki Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)" family  a   a href=" wiki Giraffidae" title="Giraffidae" Giraffidae  a , along with its closest extant relative, the  a href=" wiki Okapi" title="Okapi" okapi  a . Its scattered range extends from  a href=" wiki Chad" title="Chad" Chad  a  in the north to  a href=" wiki South_Africa" title="South Africa" South Africa  a  in the south, and from  a href=" wiki Niger" title="Niger" Niger  a  in the west to  a href=" wiki Somalia" title="Somalia" Somalia  a  in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit  a href=" wiki Savannah" class="mw-redirect" title="Savannah" savannahs  a  and  a href=" wiki Woodland" title="Woodland" woodlands  a . Their food source is leaves, fruits and flowers of woody plants, primarily  a href=" wiki Acacieae" class="mw-redirect" title="Acacieae" acacia  a  species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. They may be preyed on by  a href=" wiki Lion" title="Lion" lions  a ,  a href=" wiki Leopard" title="Leopard" leopards  a ,  a href=" wiki Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena" spotted hyenas  a  and  a href=" wiki African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog" African wild dogs  a . Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.  a href=" wiki Dominance_(ethology)" title="Dominance (ethology)" Dominant  a  males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.

 p The giraffe has intrigued various cultures, both ancient and modern, for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the  a href=" wiki International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature" International Union for Conservation of Nature  a  as  a href=" wiki Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species" Vulnerable  a  to extinction, and has been  a href=" wiki Local_extinction" title="Local extinction" extirpated  a  from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous  a href=" wiki National_park" title="National park" national parks  a  and  a href=" wiki Game_reserve" title="Game reserve" game reserves  a  but estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of  i Giraffa  i  in the wild.
