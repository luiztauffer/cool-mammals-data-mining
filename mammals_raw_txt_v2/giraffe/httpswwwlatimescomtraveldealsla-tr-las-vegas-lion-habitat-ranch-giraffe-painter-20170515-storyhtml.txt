 p data-page="1" For the ultimate souvenir of Las Vegas, skip the Strip's shops and galleries and consider an original piece of art by Ozzie the giraffe.  p 
 p Ozzie, the only giraffe in Nevada, has become a bit of a celebrity at  a href="http:  www.lionhabitatranch.org" target="_blank" Lion Habitat Ranch  a  in suburban Henderson, where — admittedly with a bit of help from humans — he has learned to paint while holding a brush in his teeth.  p 
 p "He loves painting on canvas because he gets his rewards afterward," Keith Evans, founder and president of the wildlife sanctuary, said in a video presentation.  p 
 p The 3-year-old giraffe gets help from trainers and painter Donovan Fitzgerald of Henderson's  a href="https:  www.facebook.com pg Arts-De-Vignettes-1069330236419387 about " target="_blank" Art de Vignettes  a  gallery.  p 
 p Ozzie gets credit for a multitude of original paintings, most of which are abstract and all of which are for sale. You can check them out and purchase them at  a href="https:  lionhabitatranch.org product custom-painting-by-ozzie-the-giraffe " target="_blank" the ranch  a  and online.  p 
 p Unframed 8-by-10 paintings sell for $40, and 9-by-12s are priced at $60. A portion of the proceeds benefits the nonprofit animal sanctuary, which is home to lions and other animals.  p 
 p Lion Habitat Ranch (382 Bruner Ave., Henderson, Nev.; (702) 595-6666) is open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Fridays through Mondays.  a href="http:  lionhabitatranch.org product general-admission" target="_blank" Tickets  a  cost $25 for adults, which includes one free admission for a child 4 to 14 years old. Additional tickets for children cost $10 each.  p 
 p For $75 to $125, you can take a behind the scenes tour that includes an opportunity to hand-feed Ozzie.  p
