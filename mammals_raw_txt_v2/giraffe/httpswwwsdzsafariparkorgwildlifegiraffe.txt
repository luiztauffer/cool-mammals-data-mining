 p Giraffes are the tallest land animals, able to look into a second-story window without having to stand on tiptoes! It takes a lot of leaves to fuel such large animals. Giraffes may eat up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food per day, nibbling on leaves from Africaâ€™s acacia trees. These trees often have thorns that keep most animals from munching on them, but those thorns don't stop giraffes! They just use their long tongue to reach around the thorns.  p 
 p The Uganda giraffe is the only endangered giraffe subspecies. It survives in a few small, isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda. Yet at the Safari Park, we have had over 100 births so far in our large African Plains habitat!  p 
 p You can admire our giraffes from the African Plains' Kijamii Overlook or from an Africa Tram tour. Get close enough to feed them during a Caravan Safari!
