Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata   p 
 p  strong At the Detroit Zoo  strong  br 
The African Grasslands is home to three reticulated giraffes – Mpenzi, his mom Kivuli and his dad Jabari. Mpenzi means “love” in Swahili – one of the languages of East Africa where reticulated giraffes are found. Jabari (Swahili for “brave one”) seems curious and frequently explores the habitat. Kivuli (Swahili for “shadow”), is the more reserved of the two adults. The giraffe family can be found next to the Grevy’s zebras in the African Grasslands. The Giraffe Encounter, an elevated viewing platform overlooking their habitat, puts guests at eye level with the tallest creatures at the Zoo. Visitors may purchase tickets to hand-feed these gentle giants from the Giraffe Encounter deck at designated feedings times in the warm weather months. In the winter months, the giraffes can be seen indoors.  p 
 p  strong Description br 
  strong Giraffes are the largest land mammals in the world. Reticulated giraffes received their name from the brown, square-like patterns that cover their bodies with white lines in between (known as a reticulated pattern). Their long necks and legs make giraffes the tall mammals that they are. They have long, narrow faces with two fur-covered horns, or ossicones, that adorn the tops of their heads. A thin, brown-colored mane runs down their necks and they have tufts of brown hair at the ends of their tails.  p 
 p The giraffe has the same number of vertebrae in its neck as a human (there are only seven bones in its neck).  p 
 p A giraffe’s tongue can be up to 22 inches long, which makes eating leaves a breeze.  p 
 p The giraffe is capable of making sounds that are too low for humans to hear.  p 
 p A giraffe eats 16 to 20 hours a day, consuming up to 75 pounds of fresh browse.  p 
 p Giraffes get to spend more quality time together than most mammals, considering they rarely sleep more than 20 minutes each day.  p 
 p A giraffe’s heart can weigh up to 25 pounds (an adult human heart weighs about 10 ounces).  p
