 p The Abilene Zoo’s exciting Giraffe Safari exhibit is the result of four years of staff and volunteer work and $3.8 million of support from the community. An impressive 1,000 people and organizations donated to the project, which opened in April 2016. The multi-species exhibit is 30,400 square feet – double the space of the old giraffe habitat, allowing the animals to run and display more behaviors found in the wild.  p

The mayor declared May 24, 1968, as “G-Day” and cut the ribbon on the “Highneck Bridge.” The community fell in love with the animals. Indeed, the bridge was cutting-edge zoo design in its day — making Abilene one of the first zoos in the nation to let guests interact with the leggy animals.  p 
 p  span style="font-size: 14px;" These omnivores live in the scrubs and grasslands of Africa and have lifespans of up to 150 years.  Aldabras are the second largest tortoise in the world – second only to the Galapagos tortoise. Interestingly, Charles Darwin had a hand in saving the species from extinction when he asked government officials to protect their breeding grounds.  span   p 
 p  span style="font-size: 14px;" These monkeys live in the rainforests of Africa and are vulnerable because of diminishing habitat. Unlike other monkeys, Colobus do not have thumbs, but they manage to swing gracefully using four digits cupped in the shape of a hook. Our troupe likes to dine on vegetables and nap.  span   p 
 p  span style="font-size: 14px;" Our colorful pair is a guest favorite! Red river hogs live in the African rainforest, dining on berries, roots, and other plants, as well as small reptiles and insects. We have a male and female named Shooter and Amber.  When Shooter catches up in size to the female, the two will be a breeding pair.  span   p 
 p  span style="font-size: 14px;" This petite member of the antelope family typically lives in the rainforests of central Africa, dining on fallen fruit, nuts, flowers and fungi. The smallest of these can weigh in at only 8 pounds, spending 75 percent of its day foraging for food.  span   p 
 p  span style="font-size: 14px;" These large birds are thought to be the heaviest creature capable of taking flight, which they only do when in danger. Native to the grasslands of Africa, they are ground-dwellers that dine on insects and reptiles.  span   p 
 p  span style="font-size: 14px;" The intriguing birds like to keep an eye on zoo guests. Their kinfolk live on the savannahs of Africa and are known for not being too picky about food. They’re scavengers that will eat anything. Their lifespan can be 25 to 40 years, and they mate for life.  span   p
