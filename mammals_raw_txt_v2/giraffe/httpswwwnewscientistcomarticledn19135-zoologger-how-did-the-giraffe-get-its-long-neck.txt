 p Around 15 million years ago, antelope-like animals were roaming the dry grasslands of Africa. There was nothing very special about them, but some of their necks were a bit long.  p 
 p Within a mere 6 million years, they had evolved into animals that looked like modern giraffes, though the modern species only turned up around 1 million years ago. The tallest living land animal, a giraffe stands between 4.5 and 5 metres tall – and almost half that height is neck.

 p Most people assume that giraffes’ long necks evolved to help them feed. If you have a long neck, runs the argument, you can eat leaves on tall trees that your rivals can’t reach. But there is another possibility. The prodigious necks may have little to do with food, and everything to do with sex.  p 
 p The evidence supporting the high-feeding theory is surprisingly weak. Giraffes in South Africa do spend a lot of time  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1086 509940" browsing for food high up in trees  a , but elsewhere in Africa  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1111 j.1439-0310.1991.tb01190.x" they don’t seem to bother  a , even when food is scarce.  p 
 p Giraffes’ necks are long, but there have been longer ones.  a href=" article mg20127001-400-how-the-largest-dinosaurs-got-so-big" Sauropod dinosaurs  a  trump them easily&amp;colon; the dinosaur  a href="http:  www.paleoglot.org files He&amp;_96.pdf"  i Mamenchisaurus  i   a , for instance, had a neck over 9 metres long, four times the longest of giraffe necks.  p 
 p Long necks come at a cost. Because a giraffe’s brain is around 2 metres above its heart, the heart has to be  a href=" article mg15521004-100-a-heart-for-heights" big and powerful  a . In fact, for the blood to reach the brain it has to be pumped at the  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1242 jeb.02277" highest pressure of any animal  a . So there must be a big payback to keep giraffes’ necks so long.  p 
 p The latest theory – and it’s a surprise this hasn’t come up before, given biologists’ fixation with it – is that the long necks are the result of sexual selection&amp;colon; that is, they evolved in males as a way of  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1111 j.1469-7998.2006.00197.x" competing for females  a .  p 
 p Male giraffes  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1080 00222938200770381" fight for females by “necking”  a . They stand side by side and  a href="http:  www.youtube.com watch#!v=huxDnZs2_OQ&amp;feature=fvw" swing the backs of their heads into each others’ ribs and legs  a . To help with this, their skulls are unusually thick and they have horn-like growths called  a href="http:  www.jstor.org pss 1381645" ossicones  a  on the tops of their heads. Their heads, in short, are battering rams, and are quite capable of breaking their opponents’ bones.  p 
 p Having a long and powerful neck would be an advantage in these duels, and it’s been found that  a href="http:  www.jstor.org pss 2463405" males with long necks tend to win, and also that females prefer them  a .  p 
 p The “necks for sex” idea also helps explain why giraffes have extended their necks so much more than their legs. If giraffes evolved to reach higher branches, we might expect their legs to have lengthened as fast as their necks, but they haven’t.  p 
 p The problem for the sex idea is that it implies that female giraffes shouldn’t have long necks, and they plainly do. Sexual selection often drives males to develop spectacular attributes – think  a href=" article dn13535-have-peacock-tails-lost-their-sexual-allure" peacocks’ tails  a  or the feathers of  a href="http:  animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu site accounts pictures Paradisaeidae.html" birds of paradise  a  – to impress females, but the females remain relatively dowdy.  p 
 p A  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1111 j.1469-7998.2009.00573.x" study last year  a  by Graham Mitchell of the  a href="http:  www.up.ac.za " University of Pretoria  a  in South Africa and colleagues apparently delivered a knock-down blow to the “necks for sex” theory. Mitchell’s team showed that, in Zimbabwe at least, males and females had necks that were almost exactly the same length, and that if anything the females’ necks were longer. This led many people to  a href="http:  scienceblogs.com laelaps 2009 04 can_sexual_selection_account_f.php" write off the whole sex idea  a .  p 
 p However,  a href="http:  www.fitzpatrick.uct.ac.za docs robert.html" Rob Simmons  a  and  a href="http:  web.uct.ac.za depts stats adu staff ps_res.htm" Res Altwegg  a  of the University of Cape Town, also in South Africa, have taken a second look at Mitchell’s results and are not convinced. They say the figures do show that males have proportionally longer necks, and that “Mitchell et al. appear to have misinterpreted this result”.  p 
 p They point to  a href="http:  www.jstor.org pss 2463405" a study in Namibia  a  which found that males consistently had heavier necks than females with the same body mass, and that only the males’ necks kept growing throughout their lives. Males’ heads were also heavier than females’, which is what you would expect if they were being selected for their ability to fight.  p 
 p Simmons and Altwegg suggest that giraffes’ necks may have begun growing as a way of eating hard-to-reach food, but that they were then “hijacked” for mating purposes. Once the necks had reached a certain length, males could use them for necking and clubbing – and at that point sexual selection took over, driving the necks to their current extreme lengths.  p 
 p Peacocks and birds of paradise aside, there are many birds of which the male seems to have developed colourful plumage as a result of sexual selection, but the females are also brightly coloured. Perhaps the sexual selection explanation for long necks in giraffes isn’t dead after all.  p
