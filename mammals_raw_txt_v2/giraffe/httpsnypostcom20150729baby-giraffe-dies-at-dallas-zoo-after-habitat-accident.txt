 p A baby giraffe whose April birth at Dallas Zoo was watched live by more than 2 million people worldwide died Tuesday in an accident at the park, the zoo said.  p 
 p As the giraffe herd was shifting inside for the night, Kipenzi made a sharp turn, ran into the edge of the habitat perimeter and broke three vertebrae in her neck, the zoo said in a statement.  p 
 p The giraffe died immediately, it said.  p 
 p “While she was only here for a few months, Kipenzi was a beacon of light for her species and for the millions who watched her birth live on Animal Planet,” the zoo said.  p 
 p After the giraffe’s birth, the zoo held a naming contest that settled on Kipenzi, which translates to “loved one” in Swahili.  p 
 p Her mother, Katie, visited the calf before veterinarians removed her body from the habitat.  p 
 p Kipenzi’s birth, broadcast live by Animal Planet on television and the Internet, brought attention to the plight of wild giraffes in Africa and helped raise more than $35,000 for giraffe conservation, the zoo said.  p
