 p Giraffe numbers have fallen by nearly half in just 15 years, with this majestic giant already extinct in seven countries.  p 
 p Once you see one, you’ll never forget it. Suspended five feet above the ground, the wire noose hangs from a tree, big as a kitchen table. A giraffe steps into the snare and before she can retreat, the wire quickly tightens around her six-foot-long neck. Eyes wide, she bends her neck and kicks at the dust, trying in vain to untangle herself. So begins the thoughtless destruction of a gentle, unique creature that harms no living being. Your donation to the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy helps save giraffes from extinction.  p

 p Despite being one of the most recognizable creatures on Earth, few people are aware of the giraffes’ predicament: they’re silently disappearing. Experts call it a “silent extinction”. Giraffe threats are driven by human activities, including habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as hunting and poaching.  p

 p In some rural African communities, bushmeat (wild game) is an important source of protein, and surplus meat is sold for added income. In a cruel twist of fate, some people now believe that consuming giraffe brain and bone marrow will cure HIV AIDS. This myth has placed a higher cultural value on the giraffe, and accelerated the illegal hunting of this slow-to-reproduce animal. Setting foot or neck snares in giraffe habitat is an inexpensive way to kill them and peddle their parts.  p

 p While it can be difficult to enforce anti-poaching laws (where they exist at all), it is also a challenge to change deep-rooted cultural beliefs about wildlife. But change is possible. When local people can provide more easily for their families, giraffe futures become brighter. Community conservation programs provide new jobs and opportunities for income, and help shift attitudes toward animals from nuisance to part of the family.  p

 p Your gift to the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy sponsors local conservation efforts to affect change across the board, including the rehabilitation, hand-raising, and re-release of orphaned or injured animals. Once they’re back in the wild, we watch over them through anti-poaching patrols and aerial surveillance. We can’t do it without your help.  p
