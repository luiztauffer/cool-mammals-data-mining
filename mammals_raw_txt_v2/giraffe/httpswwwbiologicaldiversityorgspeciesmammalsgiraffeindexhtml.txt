 p Known for their 6-foot-long necks, distinctive patterning  and long eyelashes, giraffes have always captured the human imagination. These amazing  African animals have the highest blood pressure among land mammals, special  valves in their heads to make sure they don't pass out after leaning over to  drink water, and tongues that can be  em 20  inches long  em .   p 
 p But these tallest of all land mammals are in the midst of a  silent extinction. Africa's giraffe population has dropped by almost 40 percent  in the past 30 years, dwindling to just more than 97,000 individuals — which  may  em seem  em  like a big number, but not  in giraffes' case (just consider their huge range, for instance).  p 
 p Giraffes face mounting threats from habitat loss and  fragmentation: Growing human populations and urban development — and the accompanying  increase in agriculture, mines, and other extractive industries — are destroying  giraffes' homes and converting their habitat for human use.   p 
 p Illegal hunting is also a problem for the species. Giraffes  are poached for their meat in many regions of Africa — as well as for their  pelts, bones, hair and tails — by hunters and trappers wielding snares, guns  and other weapons. Giraffe hair is used to make jewelry, and giraffe tails are  highly valued by some cultures.   p 
 p Giraffe populations have also been diminished by civil  unrest, military actions and war and violence.    p 
 p To many people's surprise, the United States is part of the  problem. Between 2006 and 2015, the United States imported 21,402 giraffe-bone  carvings, 3,008 giraffe-skin pieces and 3,744 giraffe hunting trophies.   p 
 p These majestic creatures were once found widely across  Africa in many different regions and  ecosystems. Most scientists agree that there are nine subspecies of giraffes: West  African, Nubian, Kordofan, reticulated, Masai, Thornicroft's, Rothschild's,  Angolan and South African. These subspecies are each unique, both genetically  and physically, often sporting entirely different patterns on their coats, and  each use their local habitats in different ways. Thus, conserving all nine  subspecies is a priority — especially since some have populations of only 400  to 600 giraffes.   p 
 p We're on the cusp of understanding so much about giraffes. Recently,  for example, scientists revealed that giraffe herds are also most likely led by  matriarchs, just like elephants. But many intriguing unanswered questions  remain:  em Why do giraffes hum at night? Why  did they develop those lovely long necks?  em   p 
 p That's why the Center and our partners  a href="http:  www.biologicaldiversity.org species mammals giraffe pdfs Giraffe_ESA_Petition_4-18-17.pdf" target="_blank" petitioned  a  to  protect giraffes under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We want to ensure that  these majestic mammals survive — and thrive — in Africa to stir imaginations  for generations to come.  p
