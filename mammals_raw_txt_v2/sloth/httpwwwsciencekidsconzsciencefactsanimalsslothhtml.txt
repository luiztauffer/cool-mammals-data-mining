 p Sloths are a medium-sized mammal.  There are two types of sloth the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth, they  are classified into six different species.  p 
 p All sloths actually have three toes,  but the two-toed sloth has only two fingers.  p 
 p Sloths are part of the order  em Pilosa  em  so they are related to anteaters  and armadillos.  p 
 p Sloths are tree-dwelling animals,  they are found in the jungles of Central and South America.  p 
 p A sloth's body is usually 50 to 60  cm long. Skeletons of now extinct species of sloth suggest some varieties used  to be as large as  a href="elephant.html" elephants  a .  p 
 p Sloths mainly eat the tree buds, new  shoots, fruit and leaves, of the Cecropia tree. Some two-toed sloths also eat  a href="insect.html" insects  a ,  small reptiles, and  a href="bird.html" birds  a .   p 
 p Sloths have a four-part stomach that  very slowly digests the tough leaves they eat, it can sometimes take up to a  month for them to digest a meal. Digesting this diet means a sloth has very little  energy left to move around making it one of the slowest moving animals in the  world.  p 
 p Sloths can move along the ground at  just 2 m (6.5 ft) per minute! In the trees they are slightly quicker at 3 m (10  ft) per minute.  p 
 p The slow-movement and unique thick  fur of the sloth make it a great habitat for other creatures such as moths,  a href="beetle.html" beetles  a ,  cockroaches, fungi, and algae. In fact, this green colored algae provides a  camouflage so sloths can avoid predators.  p 
 p Sloths can extend their tongues 10  to 12 inches out of their mouths.  p 
 p The sloth has very long, sharp, and  strong claws that they use to hold on to tree branches. The claws are also  their only natural defense against predators.   p 
 p Sloths usually only leave the tree  they live in to go to the toilet once a week on the ground. This is when they  are most vulnerable to being attacked by their main predators such as  a href="jaguar.html" jaguars  a ,  the harpy eagle and  a href="snake.html" snakes  a .  p 
 p Two-toed sloths are nocturnal, being  most active at night. While three-toed sloths are diurnal which means they are  most active during the day.  p 
 p It used to be thought sloths slept  for 15 to 20 hours a day. However, its now believed they only sleep around 10  hours a day.  p 
 p In the wild, sloths live on average  10 - 16 years and in captivity over 30 years.  p
