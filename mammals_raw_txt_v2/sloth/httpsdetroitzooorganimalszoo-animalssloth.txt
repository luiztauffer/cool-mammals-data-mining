 p  strong Description  strong   p 
 p Sloths have shaggy fur that can be grayish brown to beige in color. A green hue may be present from algae growing in the fur. Sloths have two long nails that curve at the tip on their front feet and three on their hind feet. Sloths spend nearly all of their time hanging from tree branches with a powerful grip aided by their long claws.  p 
 p Sloths are primarily nocturnal, sleeping for 15 hours during the day, and waking during the night only to feed.  p 
 p Sloths are well camouflaged in tree canopies. Their most common resting position is curled into a ball in the branches of a tree in order to protect themselves from predators.  p 
 p Sloths are relatively solitary mammals. Groups of females sometimes occupy the same tree, and young may inherit the home range of their parents.  p
