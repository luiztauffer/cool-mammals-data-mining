 p The maned three-toed sloth has a small head, tiny eyes and ears, and a small
tail hidden in its fur. It is about 50 cm (20") long and weighs up to 4.5 kg
(10 lb). Algae, mites, ticks, beetles, and even moths live in the coarse outer
coat, which is long, dark, and manelike around its head, neck, and shoulders.
Its underfur is fine, dense, and pale.  p 
 p The maned three-toed sloth is restricted to the Atlantic coastal forests of
  eastern  a href=".. country brazil.htm" Brazil  a . It is found in tropical coastal forest, most typically in
  areas with an annual precipitation of at least 1,200 mm (47"). The maned
  three-toed sloth can be found in secondary forest habitats. The maned
  three-toed sloth is found at altitudes from sea level to around 1,000 m
  (3300').  p 
 p The maned three-toed sloth eats the leaves, buds, and soft twigs of a few
forest trees, especially those of the Cecropia. It comes to the ground only to
defecate, or to move to another tree if it cannot travel through the branches.
It rarely descends to the ground because, when it is on a level surface, it is unable to stand and walk.
On the ground the sloth can only drag itself along by its longer, stronger front
legs and claws. Its main defense is to stay still and unnoticed or to lash out
with its formidable claws. On the other hand, it can swim well. The maned three-toed sloth is a solitary animal.  p 
 p Historically, the maned three-toed sloth possibly occurred in  a href=".. country brazil.htm" Brazil  a 
throughout the
coastal forest of Bahia through to the State of Pernambuco. At present, the
southern part of the State of Bahia is its remaining stronghold. In some parts
of Bahia and Espirito Santo, this species is locally abundant in forest
fragments. It has been reported from
extreme northern Minas Gerais. The remaining habitat is severely fragmented, and there
is a continuing decline in its overall population. The coastal forest habitats of the maned three-toed sloth are diminishing
rapidly and becoming severely fragmented as a result of lumber extraction,
charcoal production, and clearance for plantations and cattle pasture. The maned
three-toed sloth is also significantly threatened by excessive hunting for food
and sport. Additional threats include accidental mortality on roads and  a href=".. glossp.htm#predation" predation  a 
by domestic dogs.  p 
 p *** Anteaters, sloths and armadillos, previously called
"edentates", are now collectively known as "xenarthrans". 
This name means "strange joint." It refers to unusual joints in their
backbones - special articulations called "xenarthrales" on the
vertebrae of the lower back - which provide extra support. These animals also
all have a small brain and reduced  a href=".. glossd.htm#Dentition" dentition  a .

Doce River to the vicinity of the Mucuri River. It has been reported from
extreme northern Minas Gerais on the left bank of the Jequitinhonha River. The
maximum extent of occurrence of the maned three-toed sloth is less than 5,000 sq
km (2000 sq mi) based on the remaining forest within its range, with the actual
area perhaps much less. The remaining habitat is severely fragmented, and there
is a continuing decline in its overall population.  cite ( a href=".. refi.htm#iucn%202004%20red%20list%20-%20species%20search" IUCN
