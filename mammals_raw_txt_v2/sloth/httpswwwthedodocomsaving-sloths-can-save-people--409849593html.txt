Saving sloths could save people too -- thanks to a veritable ecosystem of fungi living in their coats. The  a href="http:  www.enn.com wildlife article 46960" research  a , published in the scientific journal  a href="http:  www.plosone.org " PLoS One  a , says that sloth hairs contain compounds that can be used against bacteria, breast cancer cells and the parasites that cause malaria and Chagas' disease.                  p

                    Because sloths move so slowly and infrequently, their fur has long been known to be a cozy home for fungus, moss and -- discovered just last week --  a href="http:  www.nytimes.com 2014 01 28 science the-sloths-busy-inner-life.html" even moths.  a  After learning about this micro-ecosystem, a team of researchers led by Sarah Higginbotham of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute was curious to examine this micro ecosystem.                  p

                    The team collected fungi samples from the fur of three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus) in Panama's Soberan√≠a National Park. They found that some of the samples helped fight against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes  a href="http:  www.cdc.gov malaria " malaria  a , while others were useful against Trypanosoma cruzi, which is responsible for  a href="http:  www.cdc.gov parasites chagas " Chagas' disease  a , a tropical parasitic disease that can be life-threatening. Many of the compounds found in the sloth fungi also were active against human breast cancer cells, as well as the species of bacteria that cause  a href="http:  www.webmd.com skin-problems-and-treatments understanding-mrsa-methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus" MRSA  a  infections,  a href="http:  www.who.int mediacentre factsheets fs107 en " cholera  a ,  a href="http:  www.webmd.com food-recipes food-poisoning tc salmonellosis-topic-overview" salmonella  a  poisoning and a host of other infections.                  p
