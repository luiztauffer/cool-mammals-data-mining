 p Sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly. They usually move at an average speed of 4 metres (13 ft) per minute, but can move at a marginally higher speed of 4.5 metres (15 ft), if they are in immediate danger from a predator. While they sometimes sit on top of branches, they usually eat, sleep, and even give birth hanging from branches. They sometimes remain hanging from branches even after death. On the ground, the maximum speed of sloths is 3 metres (9.8 ft) per minute. Sloths are surprisingly strong swimmers and can reach speeds of 13.5 metres (44 ft) per minute. sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-28" [28]  a   sup  They use their long arms to paddle through the water and can cross rivers and swim between islands. sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-29" [29]  a   sup  Sloths can reduce their already slow metabolism even further and slow their heart rate to less than a third of normal, allowing them to hold their breath underwater for up to 40 minutes. sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-30" [30]  a   sup

  p 
 p Two-toed sloths have a diverse diet of insects, carrion, fruits, leaves and small lizards, ranging over up to 140 hectares. Three-toed sloths, on the other hand, have a limited diet of leaves from only a few trees, and no mammal digests as slowly.
  p 
 p They have made adaptations to  a href=" wiki Arboreal" class="mw-redirect" title="Arboreal" arboreal  a  browsing. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients, and do not digest easily, so sloths have large, slow-acting stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic  a href=" wiki Bacteria" title="Bacteria" bacteria  a  break down the tough leaves.  As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.
  p 
 p Three-toed sloths go to the ground to urinate and defecate about once a week, digging a hole and covering it afterwards. They go to the same spot each time and are vulnerable to predation while doing so. This may be relevant for maintaining the ecosystem in the sloths' fur. sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-34" [34]  a   sup  Individual sloths tend to spend the bulk of their time feeding on a single "modal" tree; by burying their excreta near the trunk of that tree, they may help nourish it. sup id="cite_ref-Community_35-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Community-35" [35]  a   sup  Recent research shows that moths, which live in the sloth's fur, lay eggs in the sloth's feces.

  p 
 p Pale- and brown-throated species mate seasonally, while the maned sloth breeds at any time of year. The reproduction of pygmy three-toed sloths is unknown. Litters are of one newborn only, after six months'  a href=" wiki Gestation" title="Gestation" gestation  a  for three-toed, and 12 months' for two-toed. Newborns stay with their mother for about five months. In some cases, young sloths die from a fall indirectly because the mothers prove unwilling to leave the safety of the trees to retrieve the young. sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-36" [36]  a   sup  Females normally bear one baby every year, but sometimes sloths' low level of movement actually keeps females from finding males for longer than one year. sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-37" [37]  a   sup  Sloths are not particularly  a href=" wiki Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism" sexually dimorphic  a  and several zoos have received sloths of the wrong sex. sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-38" [38]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-39" [39]  a   sup
