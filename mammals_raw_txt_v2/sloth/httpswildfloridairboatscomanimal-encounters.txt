 p  span style="font-weight: 400;" Locals and tourists alike travel to Wild Florida to experience our Everglades airboat tours as they provide a great way to experience the wilderness from a fresh perspective and will give you a chance to trek through a nature preserve that’s home to a number of animals and plants that make up the Florida Everglades ecosystem. But did you know you can get up close and personal with some exotic animals at Wild Florida, too?   span   p 
 p  span style="font-weight: 400;" At Wild Florida, we offer a variety of unique animal encounters inside our Gator Park that allow you to get up close and personal with our animals inside their exhibit. All of our animal encounters have unique activities that cater to the animals’ natural behavior and help keep their mind stimulated. During our animal encounters, you will be accompanied by one of our animal care team members and have a chance to feed and perform an enrichment activity.  span   p
