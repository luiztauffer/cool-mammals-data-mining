 p class="article__paragraph" If you've ever dreamt of sleeping among a gang of sloths, there's a place in Oregon where you can do just that.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" All you need is $600 and a way to get to Rainier.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" The Zoological Wildlife Conservation Center,  a href="http:  money.cnn.com 2017 03 10 luxury sloth-portland-oregon-business-travel index.html?sr=fbCNN031117sloth-portland-oregon-business-travel0931AMStoryLink&amp;linkId=35372960" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" recently featured on CNN  a , has a sloth sleepover program that allows up to 16 people to visit with the sluggish mammals overnight. The $600 admission gets you a two-person tent for the night and a Q&amp;A sessions with center staffers.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" Visitors who don't want to commit for for a full evening can opt for one-hour sessions with the sloths and their handlers during the day. Those outings are $100 and are reserved for those 10 and older.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" Video isn't allowed, but photos are. Anyone younger than 16 will need a parent or guardian present. And the cost of the visit is due in cash on arrival.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" The requirements for a sleepover are likewise steep.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" After all, it's the sloths' world -- you just get to sleep in it for a night.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" For starters, the sleepovers are a strict "no noise, no talking zone,"  a href="http:  www.chasing-tail.com programs.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" according to the conservation center's website  a .  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" The sloths themselves are transplants from Latin America. According to the CNN report, logging companies will contact the conservation center if they plan on cutting in the animals' habitats.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" Employees then travel out to collect the animals, placing them in three research centers nearby. After they're old enough to retire, the sloths make the trek north.  p 
 p class="article__paragraph" That's right: Even sloths are moving to Oregon for retirement.  p
