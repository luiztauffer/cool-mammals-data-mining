 p Hoffman's two-toed sloths are grayish-brown to beige with a greenish cast. Their face is dark. Their tail is absent or vestigial (functionless). They have a small, rounded head; a flattened face with small, hidden ears; and narrow, curved feet. Two digits on the forefeet are bound together with skin for the entire length. Each digit has a hooklike claw approximately 3 inches long. Their hind feet have three toes with hooklike claws. Their fur can grow to be up to 6 inches long.  p 
 p The principal threats to the sloths are habitat loss, hunting, and the illegal wildlife trade. They are totally dependent upon the continued existence of the forests. The fragmentation of their habitats makes breeding increasingly difficult.  p
