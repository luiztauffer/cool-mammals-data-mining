"Animal adaptations make up some of the most fascinating educational facts we have to share with our guests. This is especially true of the sloth, an animal about which so much is unusual compared with other mammals."  p 
 p "Every animal birth is significant, and the birth of a sloth offers an opportunity for people to learn more about this species’ amazing adaptations and growth and development, which are unique among many mammals," a representative for Zoo Atlanta told  em Teen Vogue  em . "We also have a valuable opportunity to raise awareness of the threats that Hoffmann’s two-toed sloths face in the wild – threats like the pet trade and habitat loss. Bonnie is an experienced mom, and we look forward to watching her new little one grow up."  p
