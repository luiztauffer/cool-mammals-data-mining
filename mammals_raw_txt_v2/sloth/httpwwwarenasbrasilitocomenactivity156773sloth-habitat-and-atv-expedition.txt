 p style="text-align: justify;" Not just sloths! But also monkeys, birds of paradise, big cats, crocodiles and much, much more. This exciting two part tour starts with a beautiful ATV ride. Spend some exploration filled hours enjoying the beautiful beaches of the North Coast, leaving from all areas around Playa Flamingo, Costa Rica. Some of these beaches are really only accessible by ATV. Follow the Pacific Coast up to Playa Flamingo, stopping to see some beautiful vistas, beach fronts and natural beauty. Then take a hard right and head up the mountains on the monkey trail towards Diamante Eco-Park and ascend to an elevation of 1240' before dropping back down to sea level and entering Diamante. br
