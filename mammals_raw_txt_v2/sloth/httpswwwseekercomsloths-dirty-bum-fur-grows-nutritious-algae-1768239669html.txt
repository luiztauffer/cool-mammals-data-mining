            Food grows right on the bodies of sloths, which could be the world's best recyclers.          p

                    Sloths have a reputation for laziness, but these easy-going mammals could be the world's best recyclers, suggests a new study that finds the poop of three-toed sloths attracts moths that colonize sloth fur and lead to nutritious "algae gardens," which the sloths eat.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    The trees that the sloths live in, the moths, and the sloths themselves all benefit from the unusual chain of events, according to the paper published in the latest issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Lead author Jonathan Pauli of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Department of Forest and Wildlife Ecology first suspected something unusual was up after watching a David Attenborough video on YouTube called "Mouldy Sloth."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    While footage shows a sloth covered in gloppy green algae and moths, Attenborough says, "Imagine an infestation in a shag carpet on top of a compost heap."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Pauli knew this seeming mess had to be for a reason. He and his colleagues went to San José, Costa Rica, to study three-toed sloths in their native habitat.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Sloths spend most of their time resting or eating in the forest canopy but, once a week, they laboriously -- and at risk from wild dog and cat predators -- descend their trees to defecate, thereby fertilizing the trees, Pauli told Discovery News.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    The researchers determined that the dung harbors dung-eating moth larvae that, as Pauli said, "eats its way out of the waste." Sloths obviously don't have toilet paper, so some waste sticks to their bums. When adult moths emerge from the poop -- both from the forest floor and from the sloth bums -- the moths fly into sloth fur.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    But the unusual set of events doesn't end there.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    The moths themselves then poop, die and decay. The rather gross mixture, when combined with other organic materials on sloth fur, results in the growth of what the researchers call green "algae gardens."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    "Sloths eat the nutritional algae, which contains nitrogen and phosphorous," Pauli said. "It's like pepper on top of sloth waste. The green coloration also provides sloths with camouflage."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    The relationship between sloths and moths is known as mutualism, where two species mutually and closely benefit from each others' lifestyles. Other examples include cleaner fish that eat parasites off of reef fish, and ants that defend acacia trees.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    In this case, the moth presence could be a lifesaver for sloths.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Adriano Chiarello, a conservation biologist at the University of São Paulo, found that sloths are strict arboreal herbivores -- meaning plant-eating tree dwellers -- that primarily eat leaves, "survive on an energy-poor diet," and have "a very long passage time of digesta." In other words, their metabolism is so slow they can wait a week before pooping.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                                      p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Pauli said the sloths groom each other while in the trees. While doing so, they ingest the algae, which provides the much-needed nutritional boost.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    It's a tightly structured system without much flexibility.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Pauli said less than .2 percent of all animals are arboreal herbivores. Another well-known example is the koala.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    "Herbivores (like cows) tend to be very big because they often carry within themselves a ton of machinery to hold and emulsify their food," he said. "On the other hand, life as a prey animal in trees necessitates a smaller body size, so arboreal herbivores are caught between these two extremes and have a constrained lifestyle as a result."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Pauli and his team are conducting a larger study of sloths and their genetics in hopes of learning more about them and improving their conservation. Some species of three-toed sloths, such as the pygmy and maned three-toed sloths, are among the world's most critically endangered species.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    The soiled fur of sloths attracts moths, which then die and rot and contribute to the growth of tasty algae gardens.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Sloths are so photogenic that they have been recruited to serve as animal ambassadors for Suriname, a country in northern South America. The laid back animals are also helping out The Guiana Shield, a tropical wilderness region known as The Guiana Shield.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Rebecca Field, video production manager at Conservation International, made this effort possible by traveling to Green Heritage Fund Suriname, which is essentially a sloth orphanage run by Monique Pool.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Field said, "When we arrived at her house, we quickly became 'slothified' -- a term Monique came up with to describe her situation. It means "overwhelmed by sloth."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Sloth in a bowl, anyone?                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Life was not always so happy for this little guy. Kevin Connor, media manager for Conservation International, told Discovery News that sloths like this, before their rescue by Pool, "had gradually been migrating into one forest patch, an undeveloped area of the city that was finally being cut down."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    When exposed to human kindness, the natural friendliness and curiosity of sloths often is evident. Here, the sloth looks to be reaching out to the viewer, but this would have really been the photographer, Becca Field.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Sloths frequently form bonds with humans. Like primates, sloths will sometimes cling to humans similar to the way that infants do.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Russ Mittermeier, seen here, is the president of Conservation International. He and others are interested in Suriname. Connor explained its importance. "This country, roughly the size of Florida, contains 25 percent of the world's remaining intact forest."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    The word "sloth" is synonymous with laziness, but these animals are just conserving precious energy reserves when they lounge around like this.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Leaves are their main source of nutrition, but leaves provide little energy and can be difficult to digest.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    This sloth seems to be looking at the camera, but it is likely interacting with Field.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    She said, "Since the day I first laid eyes on a sloth, I have been obsessed. How could I not be? They're adorable, gentle, slow-moving creatures with irresistible smiles."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    As an ambassador for Suriname, helping to draw attention to the nation's wildlife, this individual has much to be proud of, as evident in this photo. Connor explained, "Monique's organization, along with CI, is working to show the value that these animals have as a tourist attraction in order to get them their own park in the region."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    "Sloths -- being, in my opinion, the cutest of all forest dwellers -- make great ambassadors for the forests of the Guiana Shield," Field said.  "Like all of us, they depend on the forest to survive and thrive. They spend virtually all their time in the treetops -- eating, sleeping and even giving birth in the trees. The more time I spent with them, the more I learned firsthand why it is so important we conserve areas like the Guiana Shield."                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    Sloths seem to love positive attention and will respond with all sorts of cute poses. Here an individual tilts its head affectionately for Field.                  p 
 p class="body-text__paragraph-text font--body has-spacing" 
                    "The forests might be homes to the sloths, but they also provide us with many of the things we need to survive and thrive: clean air, fresh water, a stable climate and countless other benefits, both mental and physical," Field said. "Together, with the sloths as our inspiration, we can help conserve what is important to us all."                  p
