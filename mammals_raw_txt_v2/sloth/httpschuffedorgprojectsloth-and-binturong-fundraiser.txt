 p Our current ones are old and falling apart, so we started looking for new ones.   We found a local welding company who will build us state of the art habitats that will last a lifetime.  They are giving us a massive discount because they know the work we do.  They wil even deliver and set them up at no charge.  Their normal price is almost $10,000, but our cost is only $4800 for everything.  p 
 p Our sloths &amp; Popcorn (our binturong) really need new indoor enclosures for the winter, but we just don't have the funds.  If you enjoy all our animal photos, videos and stories, then please donate. We are a licensed, no-kill, non-profit exotic animal rescue educational facility.  You can check our web site at www.iwantanimalmagic.com  p
