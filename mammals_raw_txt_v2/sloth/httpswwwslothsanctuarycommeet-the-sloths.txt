 p  a href="http:  www.meettheslothstv.com " Meet The Sloths  a  follows a year in the life of the slow-moving sloth residents here at the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica. We currently house about 150 injured, orphaned and abandoned sloths, most of which cannot be returned to the wild due to disability or lack of mother-taught survival skills. All the sloths at the Sanctuary are here because of the negative effects of human encroachment on their natural habitat. “Meet The Sloths” gives a playful yet realistic look at our operation, the challenges we face and the reward of making a difference in these animals’ existence.  a href="http:  www.animalplanet.com tv-shows meet-the-sloths videos a-throne-fit-for-a-sloth-queen " target="_blank" Click here  a  to preview episodes.  p
