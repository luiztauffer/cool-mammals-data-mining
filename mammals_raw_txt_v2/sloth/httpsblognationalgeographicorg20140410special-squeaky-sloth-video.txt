Her new book,   em  a href="http:  www.amazon.com Little-Book-Sloth-Lucy-Cooke dp 1442445572" The Little Book of Sloth  a  em , celebrates the sloth: the cutest, cuddliest, slowest creature on this planet. The sloths featured in the book, and the video above, are lucky residents at the  a href="http:  www.slothsanctuary.com " Aviarios Sloth Sanctuary  a  in Costa Rica and the  a href="http:  www.aiunau.org" AIUNAU  a  sloth sanctuary in Colombia as well.  em   p 
 p  strong This video is absolutely adorable. Why are the sloths squeaking?  strong   p 
 p That noise is the perhaps the cutest on the planet. It goes straight for your ovaries and makes you want to protect the baby sloths. It actually quite possibly was designed to make you pay attention and want to nurture these baby animals. That peep sound is basically baby sloth for, “Help! I’m lost, where are you?”  p 
 p In the wild baby sloths spend the first three to six months of their lives clinging to their mothers. If they are separated from their mothers, they make this noise so that mom can find them again. The babies in the video are orphans that I filmed at the  a href="http:  www.slothsanctuary.com " Aviarios Sloth Sanctuary  a . Each baby is partnered with a stuffed toy or another baby sloth so that they have a snuggle partner to hug for comfort. The babies in the video, are making this noise because they have wandered away from their snuggle partner and need to find them.  p 
 p  strong What is your favorite fact about sloths?  strong   p 
 p Since they are such wonderfully eccentric creatures and so massively misunderstood, I have lots of favorite facts. I love the fact that despite the fact that they are lazy and sleepy, they are extremely successful animals. As busy bipedal apes, we are obsessed with moving faster than nature intended. But being slow is a very successful strategy. In  a href="http:  books.google.com books?id=HS9S5bOHUWUC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=rainforest+survey+mammalian+biomass+can+be+made+up+of+sloths&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fgVHU4avH9Cu7Aa47YDYCg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rainforest%20survey%20mammalian%20biomass%20can%20be%20made%20up%20of%20sloths&amp;f=false" one survey  a , of the rainforests in Surinam and Panama, they discovered that up to two-thirds of the mammalian biomass can be made up of sloths, which is biology speak for, “We’re doing pretty well thank you!” Being fast is overrated.  p 
 p  strong What sorts of threats are sloths facing?  strong   p 
 p The same as most animals. Habitat destruction is probably the main threat and the reason why the pygmy sloths of Panama and the maned sloths of Brazil are both increasingly endangered.  p 
 p Trafficking is also a problem with many exotic animals these days. It is very important for people to remember that these baby sloths may be cute, but they are residents of a sanctuary and will hopefully be released back into the wild when they get older. Sloths live for up to 45 years and have highly specialised diets. Most importantly though, adult wild sloths have a surprisingly large range and are solitary creatures. They would therefore lead miserable lives cooped up and kept as pets. If you love sloths, then leave them in the wild where they are happy, and help protect their homes by supporting charities like the  a href="http:  www.edgeofexistence.org " ZSL EDGE  a  campaign who are working to save the homes of endangered species like the pygmy and maned sloth.  p 
 p If you really want a pet sloth, then you can download an APP called  a href="http:  www.jumpingpages.com apps adopt-a-sloth " Adopt a Sloth  a , which allows you to care for your very own baby sloth, as well as learn about their biology and watch more videos. A percentage of proceeds goes towards protecting the pygmy sloth as well.  p 
 p  strong You’ve made quite a few films about sloths, are they your favorite animal?  strong   p 
 p I love all sorts of strange, ugly and misunderstood creatures. Sloths are one of my favorites but top of my list has always been the original explorers, frogs, who made the great evolutionary leap from water to land.  p
