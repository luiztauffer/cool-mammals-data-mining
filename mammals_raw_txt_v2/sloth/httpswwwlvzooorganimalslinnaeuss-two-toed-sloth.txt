 p Two-toed sloths can be 21-29 inches long, weighing 8.8 lbs-17.6 lbs. Unlike most animals, their brownish-gray fur grows from their stomach to their back. This allows rain to run off their bodies as they hang from trees. They have long curved claws that allow them to hang from and move across branches. Their backs may appear green due to symbiotic algae growth. This green tint helps camouflage these animals from predators. They are known for their extremely slow movement, only moving at approximately 6-8 feet a minute.  p
