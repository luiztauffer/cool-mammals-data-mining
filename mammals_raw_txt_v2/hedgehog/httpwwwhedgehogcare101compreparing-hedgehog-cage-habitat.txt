 p Once you’ve decided that you’re ready to home  a title="Bringing Your Hedgehog Home" href="http:  www.hedgehogcare101.com bringing-hedgehog-home " bring a pet hedgehog  a , it’s time to prepare his new cage and habitat!  p 
 p Since your hedgehog will spend most of his time in his cage, we want to make sure that it’s set up properly to ensure a comfortable sleeping arrangement, play area, and food area. Now, we’ll take a look at the hedgehog cage itself, along with pricing and the different areas and items you will need to fill the cage.  p 
 p The most common hedgehog caging options are wire cages and plastic storage containers. We’ll take a look at these options to find out what would be the best fit for your home.  p 
 p At a bare minimum, the hedgehog cage should be 2 feet by 2 feet in size, though  strong 2 feet by 4 feet  strong  wide is preferable. If you have room for a larger cage, great! This will allow your hedgehog more room to explore and play. They are small, but they do stay active, so we want to make sure that there is enough room in the cage for them to move around comfortably.  p 
 p Let’s take a look at our options:  p

 p class="wp-caption-text" A great cage option by Living World. $72. br  a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product B005AYYDCM ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005AYYDCM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hedgcare101-20"  img class="size-full wp-image-261" alt="by-amazon-button-gold" src="http:  www.hedgehogcare101.com wp-content uploads 2013 11 by-amazon-button-gold.gif" width="120" height="42"   a   p 
 p Rabbit and guinea pig cages make great wire-cage options, because they are made with plastic trays specifically for small pets. In my opinion, these are the best options because the wire allows for plenty of ventilation and allows you to see your hedgehog clearly.  p 
 p You want to avoid a metal wire cage with a metal tray on the bottom, because these are cold and slippery for hedgehogs, and can rust. Plastic on the other hand, is very easy to clean.  p 
 p If you can find a cage with a deep plastic pan, about six inches, this is ideal to hold in the shavings or paper (discussed below), but is not required.  p 
 p  strong Plastic Storage Containers |   strong Average Price: $20-$40, depending on size and style  p 
 p id="caption-attachment-141" class="wp-caption-text" This Sterilite Container would be a good caging option once you drill holes in the lid. Sized about 34″ by 19″, $21. br  a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product B005AYYDCM ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005AYYDCM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hedgcare101-20"  img class="size-full wp-image-261" alt="buy-amazon-button-yellow" src="http:  www.hedgehogcare101.com wp-content uploads 2013 11 buy-amazon-button-yellow.gif" width="120" height="42"   a   p 
 p Plastic storage containers are very inexpensive compared to the other caging options, but they do require some customizing.  p 
 p You should not leave the container with no cover on, as hedgehogs are know to be little escape artists. Since the lid is solid, you will have to drill holes into the top of the container to allow for ventilation. (Never leave your hedgehog in his cage with a solid lid on – we don’t want our hedgehogs suffocating!)  p 
 p  a href="http:  www.hamorhollow.com 2007 05 24 proper-hedgehog-cages " target="_blank" Hamor Hallow Breeders  a  suggests making the holes nickel-size so that the hedgehogs cannot get stuck in the holes if they do somehow manage to make it to the top in an attempt to escape.  p 
 p Overall, we’d suggest going with the wire cage. It may be a little bit more expensive up front, but it will save you from needing to customize a storage container and as mentioned above, allows for the best ventilation and view of your hedgehog.

 p After you decide on the right cage to use for your hedgehog, the next step is to line the bottom of the cage. The three options you want to consider are fabric liners, wood shavings, or paper products. Here, we’ll go over the advantages and disadvantages of each.  p 
 p Fabric liners can be made from  strong fleece  strong  or a type of fabric called  strong Vellux  strong . Other fabrics with loose threads should not be used, because your hedgehog’s toes can become entangled and injured. You can buy your own fabric at any craft store and simply cut them into the shape of your hedgehog’s cage, or you can buy quality pre-made baby blankets to use in the cage, like the own shown to the right.  p 
 p class="wp-caption-text" This fleece baby blanket would make an excellent fabric liner, sized at 30″x40″. $8. br  a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product B0043XEILW ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0043XEILW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hedgcare101-20"  img class="size-full wp-image-261" alt="by-amazon-button-gold" src="http:  www.hedgehogcare101.com wp-content uploads 2013 11 by-amazon-button-gold.gif" width="120" height="42"   a   p

 p If you’re going to go with a fabric liner, we’d suggest buying or making at least 6 or 7 so that you have enough clean liners on hand to replace with dirty ones daily.  p 
 p class="wp-caption-text" These pine shavings are perfect for your hedgehog cage. $11 per package. br  a href="http:  www.amazon.com gp product B0035HID0E ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0035HID0E&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=hedgcare101-20"  img class="size-full wp-image-261" alt="buy-amazon-button-yellow" src="http:  www.hedgehogcare101.com wp-content uploads 2013 11 buy-amazon-button-yellow.gif" width="120" height="42"   a   p 
 p  strong Pine shavings  strong  are the best wood shaving option for hedgehogs, as they’re the most safe, inexpensive and easy to find option.  strong Aspen shavings  strong  are another good option, though may be slightly more expensive and harder to find than pine shavings. NEVER use cedar shavings or any dyed shavings, as they are contain chemicals that are toxic to hedgehogs and can lead to death.  p

 p When it comes to paper, there are two main types of products that work well for lining your hedgehog’s cage:  strong Paper pellets  strong  and strong  fluffy paper products.   strong Paper options are more absorbent than wood shavings, and according to manufacturers, smell less and therefore can be changed less often than wood shavings. Recommended brands include Carefresh, Purina Yesterday’s News, and Cell-Sorb Plus.  p
