 p The hedgehog is a small  a href=" reference glossary #jump-mammal" mammal  a  that is predominantly  found in  a href=" animals location europe " Europe  a ,  a href=" animals location asia " Asia  a  and  a href=" animals location africa " Africa  a  and the hedgehog has also been artificially introduced to New Zealand.  p 
 p The hedgehog is commonly around 25 cm long, with the hedgehogs back being covered in spikes. The hedgehog can also protect itself by curling its body into a ball so only the hedgehog spikes are exposed. This method of only exposing the spikes of the hedgehog, keeps the hedgehog safe from predators.  p 
 p The hedgehog is a  a href=" reference glossary #jump-nocturnal" nocturnal  a   a href=" reference glossary #jump-mammal" mammal  a  that naturally feasts on bugs and  a href=" animals insect " insects  a . It has been known for  a href=" animals human " humans  a  to domesticate hedgehogs in their gardens, by feeding the hedgehog year round until the hedgehog goes into  a href=" reference glossary #jump-hibernation" hibernation  a  in the winter.  p 
 p There are thought to be 16 different  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog found around the world although, oddly enough, there are no  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog that are native to  a href=" animals location oceania australia " Australia  a  and no living  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog that are native to North America.  p 
 p The spikes of the hedgehog are hollow hairs that are made from the protein  a href=" reference glossary #jump-keratin" keratin  a  (the same stuff that  a href=" animals human " human  a  hair and fingernails are made from), and unlike the spikes of the  a href=" animals porcupine " porcupine  a , the spikes of the hedgehog cannot be removed easily. The spikes of the hedgehog also differ from the spikes of the  a href=" animals porcupine " porcupine  a  as the hedgehog spikes are not poisonous or barbed.  p 
 p When baby hedgehogs get to a certain age, the young hedgehog will shed the softer baby spikes that are then replaced with the stronger and darker spikes of the adult hedgehog. Hedgehogs have also been known to shed a number of spikes when the hedgehog is under extreme stress or if the hedgehog is poorly.  p 
 p All  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog have evolved to react to their natural surroundings slightly differently. Despite the fact that hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  all commonly roll themselves into a tight ball to expose only their outward pointing spikes, some hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a , such as those hedgehogs inhabiting the  a href=" reference desert " desert  a  regions, will often try to run away from  a href=" reference glossary #jump-predators" predators  a  first leaving their spiky ball defense as a later option. This has led to hedgehogs in different  a href=" reference glossary #jump-environment" environments  a  to have different  a href=" reference glossary #jump-predators" predators  a . For example, the larger forest hedgehogs are more commonly preyed upon by owls,  a href=" animals bird " birds  a  and  a href=" animals ferret " ferrets  a , where the smaller hedgehogs that exist in more open areas are hunted by foxes, wolves and weasels.  p 
 p Hedgehogs are well known for their need to hibernate during the colder winter months although this is not true for every hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  around the world. Whether or not a hedgehog will hibernate, depends on the hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a , the climate in which they live and how much food is available.  p 
 p Most hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  are loudly vocal  a href=" reference glossary #jump-animal" animals  a  and use grunts and snuffles in  a href=" reference glossary #jump-order" order  a  to communicate between one another. Some  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog will also communicate between each other using louder squealing noises.  p 
 p The larger  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog give birth to around 3 or 4 baby hedgehogs, but the smaller hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  tend to have slightly larger litters and therefore give birth to 5 to 7 babies. When the hedgehog babies are first born, they are born blind and without their spikes. Although the spikes of the hedgehog babies can been vaguely seen under the skin, the spikes of the baby hedgehog will grow through the skin in a matter of days after the baby hedgehog has been given a thorough clean by the mother hedgehog.  p 
 p The larger  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog tend to live longer in the wild than the smaller  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  of hedgehog as the larger hedgehog  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  have fewer  a href=" reference glossary #jump-predators" predators  a . The average age of a large hedgehog is around 8 years but the average age of a small hedgehog is about 5 years. Both  a href=" reference glossary #jump-species" species  a  have known to live longer in captivity as the risk of  a href=" reference glossary #jump-predators" predators  a  has been removed.  p
