 p There are no wild hedgehogs in North or South America, Australia, or Southeast Asia. But in Europe and parts of Central Asia and the Middle East, these insectivores—larger than their domesticated American relatives—are common. But  a href="http:  www.hedgehogstreet.org data SOBH2011.pdf" target="_blank" they are not as common as they used to be  a : in the United Kingdom, the population of  em Erinaceus Europeaus  em , the Western European hedgehog, has declined by a third in the last 10 years. Recent estimates point to fewer than a million hedgehogs left in the UK.  p 
 p Like the disappearance of pollinating bees, the reasons for the decline of the hedgehog population are complex. According to  a href="http:  www.hedgehogstreet.org pages hedgehog-campaign.html" target="_blank" Hedgehog Street  a , a partnership between the  a href="http:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk " target="_blank" British Hedgehog Preservation Society  a  and the  a href="https:  ptes.org " target="_blank" People’s Trust for Endangered Species  a , some  a href="http:  www.hedgehogstreet.org pages urban-gardens.html" target="_blank" causes of hedgehog decline include  a  increased urbanization and construction in hedgehog-inhabited areas, aesthetic movements in gardening trends (a perfectly tidy garden has no space for hedgehog nests and no predator protection), increased chemical and pesticide use in gardens, and fatal interactions with humans or vehicles.  p 
 p In rural areas the hedgehog decline has been even more dramatic. A major contributing factor has been  a href="http:  www.hedgehogstreet.org pages rural-gardens.html" target="_blank" the loss of hedgerows  a : “Due to agricultural intensification, there has been around a 50 percent decline [of hedgerows] in rural Britain since 1945. Hedgerows provide ideal locations for hedgehog nesting sites as well as being important movement corridors.”  p 
 p To help the hedgehog population coexist with suburbia, some  a href="http:  www.npr.org sections parallels 2016 01 26 464307528 british-homeowners-build-a-new-superhighway-for-hedgehogs" target="_blank" British homeowners are campaigning  a  for the creation of hedgehog highways. This network of small holes in fences will help combat hedgehog habitat fragmentation by connecting yards and gardens.  a href="http:  www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk news 14285493.Cumbrian_homebuilder_leads_the_way_by_creating__Hedgehog_Highways_ " target="_blank" One building firm is even advertising this as a feature  a  of their new constructions: each property’s fencing will have a roughly 5-inch by 5-inch hole in it. This passageway is too small to be used by domesticated pets, but it’s the perfect size for hedgehog transit.  p 
 p This week, May 1–May 7, the British Hedgehog Preservation Society is urging hedgehog supporters in the United Kingdom to learn about the many small things that homeowners can do to make their yards hedgehog friendly, during  a href="http:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk hedgehog-awareness-week-2016 " target="_blank" Hedgehog Awareness Week 2016  a .
