 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" It is over 30 years since Frances Le Sueur
        presented evidence that the hedgehog was first
        established in Jersey in the mid nineteenth century and
        by the mid 1970s had become widespread across the whole
        island (Le Sueur, 1976). Meanwhile, this popular and
        charismatic animal appears to have suffered a significant
        decline in mainland Britain, probably at least partly due
        to the increased numbers of badgers (Morris, 2006). It
        therefore seemed timely to conduct a survey of this
        species in Jersey, particularly as badgers are absent
        here  font  font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Arial" .   font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" A questionnaire form was designed with the
        intention of collecting data on:  font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" The questionnaires were distributed widely
        and the public were invited via radio and newspapers to
        ask for more copies. Four thousand were printed for
        distribution and more than 1,400 observations were
        submitted by members of the public covering the period
        May to November 2007, although some observations were
        submitted that related to dates outside this time (and
        have been included here). The questionnaires were
        accompanied by a map of Jersey dived into grids squares
        so that records could be easily marked directly on it.
        This was an attempt to avoid confusion resulting from
        people submitting incorrect grid references or
        identifying the same localities under different names
        through using a variety of different maps. The forms were
        completed anonymously to avoid some of the problems with
        asking for names, and the subsequent analysis has had to
        take account of possible replicated information (eg the
        same animals repeatedly visiting the same garden, or the
        same road casualties being seen by more than one person),
        see below. Twelve records were omitted as being too
        incomplete. Information was submitted for every month of
        the year, although the majority of observations were made
        during the summer months. A few animals were seen in
        daylight, usually a sign that they are sick.  font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" After eliminating probable duplicate records
        (ie multiple sightings of the same animal, identified as
        being reported from the same grid square in the same
        month), there were 626 records based on road casualties,
        346 observations of hedgehogs visiting gardens and 93
        seen (mostly alive) elsewhere. These 1065 records form
        the basis for the distribution map in Figure 1. They are
        likely to include a few duplicate records, but not
        sufficient to affect significantly the apparent
        distribution of the hedgehog in Jersey. Observations
        elsewhere (Bright, pers comm.) confirm that numbers
        killed on roads do correspond to numbers alive, so road
        casualties represent a rough index of abundance. Fig. 1
        shows the comparative abundance of records for different
        parts of Jersey. It appears that hedgehogs are widespread
        and occur in all the available habitats, from urban
        gardens and farmland to the moist areas of Waterworks
        Valley and even the dry land of St Ouens. However, to a
        considerable extent Fig. 1. also indicates the areas most
        frequented by observers.  font   p 
 p  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" There
        appear to be a number of hedgehog blackspots
        in Jersey, including the Rte de Trodez (St Ouen), Five
        Mile Road (with at least 11 animals being killed there)
        and the Rte Orange, with probably a dozen or more
        casualties. A few of these animals may have persisted as
        dried remains long enough to be recorded in more than one
        month and thus counted twice, but it is still clear that
        these are areas where significant animals were killed.
        There were also multiple reports from the Airport Road,
        many of which obviously referred to the same individuals
        and simply reflect the large numbers of people who
        noticed them. Several people reported the one dead on the
        Gorey coast road, outside the Barbecue site, probably a
        good place for hedgehogs to feed!  font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" The questionnaires invited people to comment
        on whether or not they still saw hedgehogs or no longer
        did so. Often the same comments would be attached to a
        series of roadkill reports, so to avoid this type of
        bias, only the sightings in gardens are referred to here.
        Householders would also likely be aware of changing
        hedgehog numbers in their garden, especially if they had
        lived there for a long time. Of the 346 reports
        originating in gardens, 141 included comments about
        changing status. Of these, six reports said that the
        animals no longer visited, three said that hedgehogs had
        never been seen in the garden and 132 confirmed that the
        animals used to come and still do. This is encouraging,
        especially as at least 20 observers had lived locally for
        more than 30 years (and one for 76 years!). However, only
        one or two respondents suggested there had been no change
        in hedgehog abundance and nobody commented on a perceived
        increase. On the contrary, there were several pessimistic
        comments to the effect that hedgehogs are not as common
        now as they were previously, and this was also implicit
        (although not stated explicitly) in may of the answers
        submitted.  font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="6" face="Arial"  b  u Threats  u   b   font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" Increased traffic, agricultural
        intensification and changes to gardens and their
        immediate environment were cited by several people as
        possible causes of decline. However, at least one third
        of respondents blamed new housing, particularly infill
        development, for compromising hedgehog habitats and
        numbers. A couple of observers were more explicit, saying
        that the building of walls had impeded hedgehog
        movements. This is a common problem in many suburban
        areas of Britain where new houses are built behind walls
        or impenetrable fences. Obstructing free movement of
        animals by fragmenting their habitats in this way
        restricts gene flow within a metapopulation (ie leading
        to inbreeding) and is a potential long-term hazard for
        many species. One person suggested climate change might
        be a threat, and this could certainly be true. A drought
        lasting several weeks would leave hedgehogs very short of
        worms and other invertebrates in the sandy soils of
        Jersey, particularly if irrigation had to cease in order
        to divert water to more immediate human use.   font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" One hedgehog was reported with a polystyrene
        cup jammed on its head. Whilst superficially amusing,
        this does represent a recent but increasing danger to
        hedgehogs. They attempt to lick out the dregs from
        within, then their spines become jammed into the stiff
        foam as the animal tries to withdraw its head. This has
        often been reported elsewhere and underlines the need for
        such litter not to be discarded carelessly. Another
        hedgehog was drowned in a garden (swimming?) pool. Pools
        and smooth-lined garden ponds are a relatively infrequent
        but nevertheless persistent threat to hedgehogs here and
        elsewhere. A small piece of chicken wire hung over the
        edge could allow hedgehogs to climb out, and save many
        lives.   font   p 
 p  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" Clearly
        the hedgehog is still widespread and probably fairly
        abundant over most of Jersey. This is very encouraging
        and hopefully will continue. Some of the threats, such as
        food shortage due to drought or loss of feeding areas,
        could be alleviated by householders putting out food in
        their gardens (as many already do). However, the steady
        loss of land to housing and other forms of hard
        development must result in an overall decline in hedgehog
        numbers and fragmentation of their remaining populations.
        Increased traffic will also be a threat, and it is clear
        that many hedgehogs already die on the roads each year-
        more than 600 in the year of   font  font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial"  strong the present survey. This must
        represent a not insignificant proportion of the total
        population of the island.   strong   font   p 
 p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:14.4pt"  font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial" We are extremely
        grateful to the many people who took time to complete the
        hedgehog survey forms and send them in. It is gratifying
        that so many local residents are willing to take their
        wildlife and environment seriously. We thank the National
        Trust for Jersey, Action for Wildlife and the Jersey
        Organic Association for circulating the questionnaire
        form among their members, and also thank Piers Sangan,

        squares, each about 0.5 km wide. Questionnaire
        respondents were invited to identify the square(s) to
        which their observations related, with their map printed
        in colour with roads and other landmarks added. This map

        each grid square, once likely replicated observations had
        been eliminated. The numbers crudely indicate relative
        abundance of hedgehogs, but also reflect the areas most
        intensively observed. There is a curious lack of records
