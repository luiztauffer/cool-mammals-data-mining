 p The hedgehog is abundant throughout its range and a popular visitor to gardens in the UK. It is mainly nocturnal when it forages for worms, slugs, earwigs,fallen fruits, eggs and surprisingly it will eat young grass snakes and adders as br they are somewhat immune to snake venom. It usually hibernates in winter which is followed by the breeding season. In the wild they may only live a few years but could reach up to 10 years.  p 
 p Hedgehog babies called hoglets are born naked and blind. But within 48 hours, a layer of fine white prickles emerge through the skin to protect them.  p 
 p Our resident hedgehogs are all rescues who cannot return to the wild for a variety of health problems, frequently eyesight trauma. At present we have Sonic and Bryan the boys, who arrived 2014. Then Hettie, arrived 2015, and Hattie, arrived in 2017, the girls.  p 
 p Sonic &amp; Hettie had a successful litter of 7 hoglets in Summer 2017, all went for wild release.  p 
 p Sonic &amp; Hattie have a litter of 4 hoglets born this May 2018, who will be released to the wild when they are ready.   p
