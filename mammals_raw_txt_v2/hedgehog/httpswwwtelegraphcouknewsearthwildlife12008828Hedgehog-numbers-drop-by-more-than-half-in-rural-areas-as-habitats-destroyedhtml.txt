 p  Hedgehog numbers have more than halved in rural Britain in the past 15 years, as intensive farming and poor hedgerow management destroys their habitats, a major new study has found.   p 
 p  Urban hedgehogs have fared only slightly better, with the fencing-in and concreting-over of city gardens contributing to a one-third decline in numbers since the year 2000.   p

 p  Reliable estimates of hedgehog numbers are hard to come by but there are now believed to be less than a million of the creatures left in the UK, based on evidence of population decline since the last comprehensive scientific study, which put the figure at 1.55 million in 1995.   p 
 p  The State of Britain’s Hedgehogs 2015 report, by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), concludes that the rate of decline has continued in both urban and rural areas since its last report in 2011.   p 
 p  Although hedgehogs being run over may also be contributing to the fall in numbers, Henry Johnson, Hedgehog Officer at PTES, said the organisations were worried by research data showing a drop in sightings of roadkill hedgehogs.   p

 p  "Obviously it’s bad seeing dead hedgehogs, but it’s generally a bad sign if you don’t see dead hedgehogs on the road in an area, because it means there aren’t that many in the surrounding countryside," he said.   p 
 p  The report suggests manmade activities to destroy hedgehog habitats are largely to blame for the losses and exonerates badgers – despite the fact numbers of badgers,  a target="_blank" href="https:  www.telegraph.co.uk news earth earthcomment country-diary 10274628 Country-diary-are-badgers-killing-hedgehogs.html" which kill and eat hedgehogs as well as competing for other food sources  a , have increased.   p 
 p  "The downward hedgehog trend is the same whether badgers are present or not," it concludes.   p 
 p  Previous studies have suggested hedgehogs thrived in areas where badgers were culled.   p

 p  It says that gamekeepers’ records suggest long-term decline in hedgehog numbers in the UK over the last century.   p 
 p  But Mr Johnson said estimates that hedgehog numbers were as high as 30 million in the 1950s were based on poor methodology and likely to be over-estimates.   p 
 p  He said it was “unlikely” that hedgehogs would become extinct because they were “still a fairly common animal” but warned they could well become absent from large areas of the country.   p

 p  The dramatic fall in rural hedgehog numbers fits with recent studies suggesting much arable farmland is now “poor quality for hedgehogs, with few good foraging areas of nesting sites”, the report says.   p 
 p  Hedgehogs use hedgerows for navigation, nesting and sheltering from predators, but hedgerows continue to be lost as farmers seek efficiency through larger fields and hedges are poorly managed using “flailing” machines to chop them back, Mr Johnson said.   p 
 p  He said urban hedgehog populations depended on the ability to roam across large areas, “on the scale of neighbourhoods rather than streets”.   p 
 p  These habitats had been fragmented by fences, which are problematic for hedgehogs as they are “not very good at climbing”, he said, while the spread of patios and people concreting over gardens for parking is also destroying habitats.   p
