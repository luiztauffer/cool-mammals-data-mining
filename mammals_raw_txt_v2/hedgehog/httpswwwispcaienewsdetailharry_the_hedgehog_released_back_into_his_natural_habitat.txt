 p A few weeks ago we shared a story about Harry the hedgehog, who was rescued after being caught in some plastic fencing. Harry had injuries from the fencing, as well as a wound possibly caused by a garden strimmer. Harry has been recovering from his injuries at the ISPCA National Animal Centre, and reaching a healthy target weight to allow him to hibernate through the winter months. Thanks to the great work of staff at the Centre trained to care for wildlife, he was healthy and ready to be released back into his natural habitat last week! Watch the video below to see his release.Â   p 
 p Hedgehogs at this time of year will be building up fat reserves, as they begin their hibernation typically in October. Please be careful liWaghting fire or disposing of undergrowth at this time of year, as hedgehogs go into true hibernation and cannot be woken.  p
