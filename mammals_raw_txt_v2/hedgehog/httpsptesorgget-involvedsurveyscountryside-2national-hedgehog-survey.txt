 p We need your help to carry out a survey of hedgehogs across sites in England and Wales.   p 
 p Long-term studies by ourselves, People’s Trust for Endangered Species, and the British Trust for Ornithology have found that hedgehogs have undergone a drastic decline within Britain over the last two decades (see  a href="https:  ptes.org wp-content uploads 2014 06 SOBH2011lowres.pdf" State of Britain’s Hedgehogs 2011  a ). Our humble hedgehog is now listed as a species of principal importance to protect.  p 
 p That is why the  em National Hedgehog Survey  em  was carried out by  a href="http:  www.reading.ac.uk " target="_blank" University of Reading  a  and  a href="http:  www.ntu.ac.uk " target="_blank" Nottingham Trent University  a , in collaboration with  a href="http:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk " target="_blank" British Hedgehog Preservation Society  a  and  a title="Home" href="https:  ptes.org " target="_blank" People’s Trust for Endangered Species.  a   p 
 p Until recently it has been difficult to find out how our nations’ hedgehogs are being affected by certain factors because of the lack of a suitable and reliable technique to study them. However, a recent pilot study by The Mammal Society, the University of Reading and Nottingham Trent University has demonstrated that special ‘footprint-tunnels’ meet this need.  p 
 p  strong The survey has now closed and we are in the process of analysing the data.  strong   p 
 p The devastating loss of this iconic British animal is potentially linked to a range of factors that this survey is investigating, including:  p 
 p Together we are trying to find out:  p 
 p Overall, we aimed to survey a minimum of 400 chosen sites across England and Wales during the summers of 2014 and 2015.  p 
 p The data is currently being processed and once analysed will empower us to take suitable urgent action where it is most needed to save hedgehogs.  p 
 p We have a number of other simple ways you can help us to record and save hedgehogs before it is too late.  p 
 p Thank you.  p
