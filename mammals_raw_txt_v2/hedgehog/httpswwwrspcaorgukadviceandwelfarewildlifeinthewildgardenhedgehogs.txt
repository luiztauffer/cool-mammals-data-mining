 p  b Hedgehogs are a gardener’s friend, as they eat snails, slugs and insects  b .  p 
 p Leave areas of the garden ‘wild’, with piles of leaf litter and logs. These are an attractive nest as well as a home for the invertebrates (slugs, beetles) that hedgehogs like to eat.  p

 p Food and fresh water will encourage hedgehogs to return. Leave out foods like tinned dog or cat food (not fish-based) and crushed dog or cat biscuits. Specialist hedgehog food is also recommended and can be bought from wildlife food suppliers.  p 
 p  b Never feed hedgehogs milk   b as it can cause diarrhoea; instead provide plain, fresh water in a shallow bowl.  p 
 p Hedgehogs usually hibernate between November and mid March and animals must have enough fat reserves to survive hibernation. Making hedgehog homes in the garden and providing food will help hedgehogs.  p
