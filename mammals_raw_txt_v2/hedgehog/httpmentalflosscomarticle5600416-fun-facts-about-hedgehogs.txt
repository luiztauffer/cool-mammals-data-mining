 p After  a target="_blank" href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 55726 20-fun-facts-about-our-mysterious-feline-friends" cats  a , hedgehogs might be the internet's favorite animal. But how much do you know about these spiky mammals—other than how cute they look when getting a bath?  p 
 p But it doesn't come up much, since hedgehogs are solitary creatures who usually  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 551081 collective-nouns-groups-animals" target="_self" come together  a  only to mate.  p 
 p The hedgie has gained some popularity as a pet—but some cities and states still  a target="_blank" href="http:  abcnews.go.com Lifestyle hedgehogs-spike-popularity-pets story?id=22652290" qualify them as wild animals  a , which are not allowed to be kept domestically. These include Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and New York City and Washington, D.C. In some areas, like Maine, you need permits in order to own one.  p 
 p Muscles along the animal's back can raise and lower the quills to respond to threatening situations.  p 
 p Australia also has no indigenous hedgehogs; the hedgies in New Zealand were introduced by humans.  p

 p The inside of the quills are mostly hollow, with a series of complex air chambers that make them light but strong.  p 
 p Their taste for destructive insects makes them a historically welcome presence in English gardens.  p 
 p Which makes  a href="https:  www.sttiggywinkles.org.uk top-navigation wildlife-advice hedgehog-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank" them  a  one of only three mammals in Great Britain that hibernate (the other two being bats and dormice).  p 
 p This means that, although their typical diet consists of insects and berries, they can take down a viper in a fight and eat it, too.  p 
 p Before the more adorable name came into use, the spiky mammals were called " a target="_blank" href="http:  britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk digitisedmanuscripts 2012 12 the-distinguished-pedigree-of-mrs-tiggy-winkle.html" urchins  a " throughout the Middle Ages, and thus inspired the name of the similarly spiky sea creatures. Baby hedgehogs are still called urchins.  p 
 p This is inaccurate. But affinity for the image has persisted.  p 
 p But when German  a href="http:  www.groundhog.org about history " target="_blank" settlers  a  got to America and found no hedgehogs, they turned to the similar-enough groundhog for their winter-weather predictions.  p

 p Legend tells of St. Patrick using the power of his faith to drive all of Ireland’s snakes into the sea. It’s an impressive image, but there’s no way it could have happened.  p 
 p There never were any snakes in Ireland, partly for the  a href="http:  www.popsci.com why-doesnt-ireland-have-snakes" target="_blank" same reason  a  that there are no snakes in Hawaii, Iceland, New Zealand, Greenland, or Antarctica: the Emerald Isle is, well, an island.  p 
 p Once upon a time, Ireland was connected to a larger landmass. But that time was an ice age that kept the land far too chilly for cold-blooded reptiles. As the ice age ended around 10,000 years ago, glaciers melted, pouring even more cold water into the now-impassable expanse between Ireland and its neighbors.  p 
 p Other animals, like wild boars, lynx, and brown bears,  a href="http:  news.nationalgeographic.com news 2014 03 140315-saint-patricks-day-2014-snakes-ireland-nation " target="_blank" managed  a  to make it across—as did a single reptile: the common lizard. Snakes, however, missed their chance.  p 
 p The country’s serpent-free reputation has, somewhat perversely, turned snake ownership into a status symbol. There have been numerous  a href="http:  www.nytimes.com 2013 03 16 world europe boom-over-st-patricks-isle-is-slithering-again.html?_r=0" target="_blank" reports  a  of large pet snakes escaping or being released. As of yet, no species has managed to take hold in the wild—a small miracle in itself.  p

 p  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 87692 11-secrets-wildlife-photographers" target="_self" Wildlife photographers  a  have an eye for the majestic beauty of life on planet Earth, but they also know that nature has a silly side. This picture, captured by Maine photographer Roger Stevens Jr., shows a bald eagle and a gray squirrel locked in an epic staring match.  p 
 p As  a href="https:  www.wmtw.com article maine-photographer-captures-epic-standoff-between-bald-eagle-squirrel 26820935" target="_blank" WMTW Portland  a  reports, the image has been shared more than 8000 times since Stevens posted it on his  a href="https:  www.facebook.com photo.php?fbid=2382904465077329&amp;set=a.100530043314794&amp;type=3" target="_blank" Facebook  a  page. According to the post, the photo was taken behind a Rite Aid store in Lincoln, Maine. "I couldn't have made this up!!" Stevens wrote.  p 
 p 
Bald eagles eat small rodents like  a href="https:  www.nationaleaglecenter.org eagle-diet-feeding " target="_blank" squirrels  a , which is likely why the creatures were so interested in one another. But the staring contest didn't end with the bird getting his meal; after the photo was snapped, the squirrel escaped down a hole in the tree to safety.  p 
 p What was a life-or-death moment for the animals made for an entertaining picture. The photograph has over 400 comments, with Facebook users praising the photographer's timing and the squirrel's apparent bravery.  p 
 p Funny nature photos are common enough that there's an entire contest devoted to them. Here are some of  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 72711 here-are-winners-2015s-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards" target="_self" past winners  a  of the Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards.  p
