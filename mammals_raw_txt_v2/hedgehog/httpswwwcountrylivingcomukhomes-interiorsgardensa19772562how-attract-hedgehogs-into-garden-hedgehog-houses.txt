 p Hedgehog numbers in the UK have fallen by around 50% since the start of the century. Let's do something about it...  p 
 p class="body-text" After the  em State of Britain's Hedgehogs  em  report was published in February 2018, we know that hedgehog numbers in the UK have fallen by around 50% since the start of the century. The report concluded that the hedgehog population in England, Wales and Scotland is now at one million, compared with three million in the 1950s.  p 
 p class="body-text" In short, there's no better time to do our bit to make sure our gardens are hedgehog-friendly and, for that matter, are safe havens for  em all  em  wildlife.  p 
 p class="body-text" And don't assume that, just because you live in the countryside, you are more likely to host wildlife in your gardens because this year's report also found that, perhaps surprisingly, hedgehogs are declining  em more  em  rapidly in rural areas than urban ones. This is partly down to methods of intensive farming disturbing their natural habitats and nesting sites, such as hedgerows and field margins.  p 
 p class="body-text" Armed with this knowledge, and to help raise the profile of  a class="body-link" href="https:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk hedgehog-awareness-week-runs-6th-12th-may-2018 " target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk hedgehog-awareness-week-runs-6th-12th-may-2018 " Hedgehog Awareness Week  a  (6th-12th May) we met with Fay Vass from the  a class="body-link" href="https:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk " target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https:  www.britishhedgehogs.org.uk " British Hedgehog Preservation Society  a  (BHPS) at  a class="body-link" href="http:  www.valewildlife.org.uk contact-us " target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http:  www.valewildlife.org.uk contact-us " Vale Wildlife Hospital  a , near Tewksbury in Gloucestershire.

 p class="body-tip"  strong 6 THINGS YOU  u MUST DO  u  TO MAKE YOUR GARDEN HEDGEHOG FRIENDLY  strong   p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 1. Create hedgehog highways  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" "The first thing I always say is hedgehog holes!" says Fay. By this, she means making sure there are gaps in your fence or hedge so hedgehogs can travel from one garden to another. Hedgehogs travel up to one mile every night so they need to be able to roam freely.  p 
 p class="body-text" "As the name suggests," continues Fay. "They tend to stick to the edges but they'll amble around, a mile in a night foraging for food and nesting materials. The males will go further than that, especially in breeding season. They can go up to two miles."  p 
 p class="body-text" The best way to ensure hedgehogs have travel rights is to team up with your neighbours and extend the highway within your community. Visit  a class="body-link" href="https:  www.hedgehogstreet.org " target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https:  www.hedgehogstreet.org " hedgehogstreet.org  a  for more info.  p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 2. Add a hedgehog house  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" Hedgehog houses provide shelter and food for these lovely animals but they can also look stylish in your garden and act as a design feature. You can buy a ready-built house like the one below. It is made from recycled plastic and FSC wood and is recommended by the BHPS...  p

 p class="body-text" Or you can build your own house based on an original design or create a more makeshift option using a pile of logs. Simply pile the logs in an unordered fashion and pad out the gaps with leaves.  p 
 p class="body-text" "Log piles are really great," explains Fay. "Not only do they provide shelter, they also provide food as they attract bugs and insects. And they look pretty and natural."  p 
 p class="body-text" Having just one hedgehog house in your garden would be beneficial but, for an average size garden, Fay recommends having up to three houses. Just make sure they are separated because hedgehogs are lone-travelling creatures.   p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 3. Leave out water  strong  br   p 
 p class="body-text" Leaving clean water in small dishes around the garden is good for lots of wildlife if they pass through, especially in very cold months where most water is frozen at night. Leave a dish close to your hedgehog house.  p

 p class="body-text"  strong 4. Make a feeding station  strong   p

If you want to make sure the snacks are not eaten by other animals, cut a hedgehog-size hole in the end of a Tupperware, turn it upside down and secure it to the ground with a weight or tent pegs. Put the food underneath the Tupperware and only hedgehog should be able to reach it.  p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 5. Optimise your pond  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" If you have a pond, install a small ramp or sloping mound at the side to give hedgehogs safe access in and out of it. They can swim, but can find it difficult getting over steep walls.   p 
 p class="body-text" "Ponds are really good for all wildlife so we always recommend them," says Fay. "Just make sure there's easy access. Without help, the hedgehog can become exhausted trying to get out of the water."  p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 6. Leave them alone during hybernation  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" It's sometimes hard to know if you have a hedgehog hibernating in your garden – this happens between November and March – but, if you do, make sure you leave it alone.   p 
 p class="body-tip"  strong 4 THINGS YOU  u SHOULD NOT DO  u  br   strong   p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 1. Don't use slug pellets or other chemicals in your garden  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" These are toxic to most animals, including hedgehogs. It's a much better and more environmentally-friendly option to attract as much wildlife into your garden as possible, including slugs and other 'pests'. This will create a rich eco-system and the food chain will look after itself.  a class="body-link" href="https:  www.countryliving.com uk homes-interiors gardens news a2243 companion-planting-guide-best-plant-combinations " target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https:  www.countryliving.com uk homes-interiors gardens news a2243 companion-planting-guide-best-plant-combinations " Companion planting  a  is great natural way to help this process.  p 
 p class="body-text" Fay reminds us that hedgehogs do eat slugs! So attracting them into your garden is a great natural method of slug control.   p

 p class="body-text"  strong 2. Don't use netting on the ground  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" Lots of people like to use garden netting to support their plants but, if you must, make sure it is high enough off the ground so that hedgehogs can't become trapped in it and can freely walk under it. This includes football, tennis and cricket nets - try to store them away when not in use.  p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 3. Don't mow or strim your lawn without checking  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" Hedgehogs are no match for garden machinery so make sure you check and leafy, mounded areas of your lawn before giving it a haircut.   p 
 p class="body-text"  strong 4. Don't make or light a bonfire without checking  strong   p 
 p class="body-text" Piles of logs and leaves are perfect habitats for hedgehogs so make sure you check any potential fire mounds before lighting them for any life inside them.  p
