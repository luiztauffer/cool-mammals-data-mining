 p Since hogs are small but active creatures thus they love a huge amount of space, make sure to purchase a larger size of the cage than your pet. For example, the hog can grow up to 8″ in length then you must prepare a 2X2 or 2X4 feet of a cage.  p 
 p Hedgehogs can hold up to 80-degrees heat and if you’ll be asking for the use of lamps, it will be needed if your  a href="https:  mylifepets.com best-hedgehog-house " house  a  doesn’t hold that amount of heat. You will notice if the heat or cold affect your hog as their activeness fluctuates.  p 
 p One characteristic of a hog is being an anti-social and for that reason you cannot be able to put two hogs in one cage; they might hurt each other. If you decide to put them together in one cage, take the responsibility to look over them once in a while to ensure their safety.  p 
 p Hedgehog is so active that it certainly needs more rest and by putting soft stuff (such as paper shavings, towel, pillowcases and so on) on the base of its cage can add comfort when it rested. Be certain that the stuff you used is absorbent and not allergy causing materials.  p 
 p You’ll be going to buy a cage to pamper your pet comfortably and by being aware of the size of your pet you can also be aware of its cage’ size.  p 
 p Since hedgehogs have very tiny feet, consider a 1” or less bar spacing to avoid pet from escaping.  p 
 p Choose a cage with a plastic base for it provides more comfy feeling on hogs and it is easier to clean and more durable than metals which got rust in a long period of use.  p 
 p These creatures are sensitive in smelling unpleasant odors like urine thus having a wire at the top of the cage can serve as ventilation for the pet.  p 
 p Accessories such as water and food holder, ramp, hideout section, elevated areas and more are important for the wellbeing of your pet. Mostly, it is included on the purchased but on some products, it is sold separately.  p 
 p Just like humans, animals deserve a home too. A Hedgehog even if lived like a wild animal in the forest has a soft heart that longs to have cared that’s why giving it its own home will be a great move for you to do. It’s not a hard thing to do for their habitat should be like that of rabbits, guinea pig or other small animals which are easily found in the market and most of it is inexpensive. Of course, you don’t want to let that active animal roam around your  a href="https:  mylifepets.com best-hedgehog-house " house  a  thus buying it its own territory will lessen the ruin it could have done.  p
