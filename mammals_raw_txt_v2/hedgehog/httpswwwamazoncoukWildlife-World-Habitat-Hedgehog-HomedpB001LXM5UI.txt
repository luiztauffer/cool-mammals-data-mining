 p The Wildlife World Hogitat is designed to be an attractive natural home and safe retreat for hedgehogs. It features a sturdy, rust-proofed steel frame, a waterproofed roof with an attractive natural finish, and a predator defense tunnel to stop badgers and fox’s getting to them. Specifically designed to blend into the garden setting, the Hogitat has an attractive natural appearance that will comfortably nestle into any garden environment. Siting: Choose a quiet position out of the prevailing wind in an area of the garden with some nearby cover and cover with light brush if possible for extra insulation.

            We are one of the few suppliers with our own workshops that use naturally durable timbers which require more complex drying and supply plans to ensure continuity of supply but this timber eliminates the need for chemical preservatives. We only use water-based stains and paints for the safety of the animals, birds, bees and our staff.

            For many years the hedgehog was a familiar inhabitant of parks, gardens, cemeteries, railway embankments and waste ground. However, in recent times their numbers have crashed from maybe 36 million in the 1950's to less than a million today and these nocturnal animals are now a rare sight, often only spotted out in the daylight when they are in distress or unwell.

            Suburban gardens however provide the hedgehog with many opportunities for foraging, breeding and hibernating. They may be found under compost heaps, under log piles, behind sheds and below hedges as their name suggests. You can also provide safe haven for hedgehogs by purchasing a Wildlife World HOGITAT or Hedgehog IGLOO. Gardens are excellent sources of food for hedgehogs, such as worms, slugs and beetles. Gardens are even more valuable if they interconnected to neighbours gardens via holes in the bottom of garden fences to make a good size hedgehog territory.
