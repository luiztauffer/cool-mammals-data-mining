 p Koala Bears live in trees. These trees are called eucalypt trees. They spend the majority of their lives on trees and not much time on the ground. The reason being is because leaves are on trees not on the ground. The energy for a Koala to get from the ground and back up to the tree would take the bear multiple days maybe weeks in order to get back to the branches full of leaves.  p 
 p Koalas are natives of Australia. They are located in the low woodlands of the eastern side of Australia. The reason why Koalas enjoy their time on the east side is because of the trees which grow on rich moist soil. This is why the population of Koalas is so dense and it is important for us humans to keep these habitats open for these precious animals.  p 
 p The problem is that due to population increase Koalas are losing their homes. Trees are getting cut for residential areas on the eastern side of Australia and this is making Koala Bear numbers decrease. Their numbers have decreased significantly since more people moved to Australia. With this problem at hand we need to combat this with relocation!  p
