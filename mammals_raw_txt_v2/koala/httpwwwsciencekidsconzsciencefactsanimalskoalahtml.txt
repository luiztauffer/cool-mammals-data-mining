 p Koalas are  native to Australia.  p 
 p Koalas are  not bears.  p 
 p Koala  fossils found in Australia have been dated as long ago as 20 million years.  p 
 p Koalas eat  eucalypt leaves and almost nothing else.  p 
 p The brain  size of modern koalas has reduced substantially from their ancestors, possibly  as an adaptation to the low energy they get from their diets.  p 
 p The closest  living relative of the koala is the wombat.  p 
 p Koalas have  sharp claws which help them climb trees.  p 
 p Koalas have  similar fingerprints to humans.  p 
 p Koalas have  large noses that are coloured pink or black.  p 
 p Outside of  breeding seasons, koalas are quiet animals.  p 
 p A baby koala  is called a ‘joey’.  p 
 p Joeys live  in their mother’s pouch for around six months and remain with them for another  six months or so afterwards.  p 
 p Koalas cannot be kept legally as pets.   p
