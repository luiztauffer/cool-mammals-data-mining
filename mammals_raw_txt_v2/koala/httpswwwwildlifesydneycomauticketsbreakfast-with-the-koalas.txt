 p ”My husband and I had breakfast with koalas and it was a truly unique experience. The breakfast is a buffet style but I was very impressed with how good the food was. Then you get to have your picture taken with the koalas. I would say this is a must do!”  p 
 p ”The ticket price is totally worth the experience. You get to visit the zoo before opening time even after the guided tour. Our guide was excellent and you could see the passion for his work. The animals seem well treated. A little artificial location but the animal’s habitat looks well cured. Good breakfast also!”  p 
 p ”This was a wonderful experience. We had a delicious breakfast where we could watch the koalas and have our photos taken with them. I would recommend this to anyone and they would be lucky to have Justine as their tour guide.”  p
