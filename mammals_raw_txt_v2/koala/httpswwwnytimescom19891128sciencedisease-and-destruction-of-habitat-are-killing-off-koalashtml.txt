 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="189" THE koala, a furry marsupial that lives almost exclusively in eucalyptus trees in the wilds of Australia, is at risk of becoming an endangered species, environmentalists and zoologists say.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="420" data-total-count="609" Over the last 50 years, the population of koalas has dwindled from more than several million to 400,000 and is continuing to decline, scientists say. The decline is mainly a result of destruction of the koala's natural habitat and unchecked spread of disease among the animals. Nearly 80 percent of the koala's natural habitat and food supply has been wiped out by human development along the eastern coast of Australia.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="879" ''If we don't sound the alarm now, it soon may be too late,'' said Dr. Werner Heuschele, director of the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species at the San Diego Zoo. ''Right now there is the potential for the development there to strip away the koala's habitat.''  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="468" data-total-count="1347" While scientists say the major threat is from the destruction of the animal's habitat and food supply, they note that about 40 percent of all koalas are infected with chlamydia, a type of venereal disease. $5 Million Campaign If it remains unchecked, chlamydia is likely to spread to an even larger portion of the koala population, said Debbie Tabart, director of the Australian Koala Foundation, which has begun a campaign to raise $5 million to help save the animal.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="151" data-total-count="1498" id="story-continues-1" Preliminary research indictates that chlamydia among koalas can cause blindness, female infertility, pneumonia and bladder infections, scientists said.  p 
 p Advertisement  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="150" data-total-count="1648" id="story-continues-3" Because of the uncontrolled spread of the disease, any large-scale relief effort will now require a quarantine of noninfected koalas, scientists said.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="189" data-total-count="1837" ''There is finally some acceptance that the koala has a problem,'' Ms. Tabart said. ''Unless we do something about it now, we are going to face some serious problems in the next 50 years.''  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="2086" The destruction of thousands of eucalyptus trees, also known as gum trees, to make room for farmland, new homes and tourist development along Australia's east coast, has radically reduced the available food supply and habitable territory for koalas.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="340" data-total-count="2426" The koala, is a robustly built animal that is gray to gray-brown in color and is about two feet long. It , depends on a diet consisting almost entirely of the leaves and shoots of the eucalyptus tree. There are more than 600 species of the tree, but the koala eats only the leaves of about one-sixth of the species. Malnutrition and Disease  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="250" data-total-count="2676" ''A lessening of the available food source will lead to malnutrition, disease, poor survivability rates and poor reproductive ability,'' said Dr. Heuschele of the San Diego Zoo, which has 30 koalas, the largest exhibit of koalas in the United States.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="2952" The construction of resorts and housing developments in Australia is also fragmenting the koala's habitat, he said. ''The koalas like to move from one place to another, and if you block their access, it limits their ability to find food and their ability to forage,'' he said.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="3077" In addition, he said, a recent study found that the most common cause of death of koalas is from being struck by automobiles.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="3187" With the exception of a small number of koalas in zoos around the world, the koala is found only in Australia.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="790" data-total-count="3977" id="story-continues-4" Despite the popularity of the animal, scientists say much of the biology of the koala remains unknown. Koalas are primarily nocturnal animals, and spend most of the daylight hours sleeping in eucalyptus trees. The female usually gives birth to only one offspring during the annual breeding season, and the premature baby is nurtured in the mother's pouch for six to seven months before it is strong enough to set out on its own. Koalas mature in about four years and live to be about 20 years old. The relief effort led by the Australia Koala Foundation is seeking to raise money for research on chlamydia as well the preservation of large tracts of land for the koala. Other organizations taking part include the World Wildlife Fund and the Australian Conservation Fund. Setting Aside Land  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="4224" Environmentalists have been mainly concentrating their efforts on encouraging local governments and businesses to set aside tracts of land for the koalas. In addition, further research on the eating and living habits of the koala is now under way.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="243" data-total-count="4467" ''The east coast is some of the country's most beautiful territory,'' Ms. Tabart said. ''Although people want to be there, there has been no provision made for the koalas. The trees that are being cut down are their homes and their kitchens.''  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="226" data-total-count="4693" While millions of koalas once populated nearly the entire Australian continent, settlers in the 19th century began killing them for their skins and by the late 1920's the animals had vanished from the wilds of South Australia.  p
