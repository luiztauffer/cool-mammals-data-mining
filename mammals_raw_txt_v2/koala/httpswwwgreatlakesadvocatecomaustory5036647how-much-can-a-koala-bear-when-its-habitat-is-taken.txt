 p They are without a doubt one of our most loved and popular native animals – the poster animal for all things cute and cuddly.  p 
 p But, these native Australians are under threat from urbanisation as more and more developers remove their natural habitat. br   p 
 p These two little fellas were snapped at Tallwoods and Red Head, possibly disturbed by developers putting in a new road near the koala corridor at Seascape.  p
