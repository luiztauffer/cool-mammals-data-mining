 p   img src=".. .. images animals adult-koala_1.jpg" alt="Koala" width="220" height="232" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right"  The
            Koala is the only member of the Phascolarctidae family. The Koala’s
            scientific name  em Phascolarctos cinereus  em  means ‘ash-coloured
          pouched bear’.  p 
 p   Some people refer to the Koala as a Koala Bear. Although it looks
          like a small bear, the Koala is a marsupial mammal.   p 
 p Female marsupials
            have pouches to carry their babies. Other marsupials include kangaroos,
            wallabies, wombats, possums, and opossums. The Koala’s closest
          relative is the wombat.   p 
 p In Aboriginal language, the word Koala is thought to mean ‘does
          not drink’.   p 
 p   Koalas have soft, wool-like grey fur, which is paler on their
            undersides. They have patches of white on their stomachs, chests
            and chins and a fringe of white around their ears. They have a large,
            round head with large, round, furry ears, a large nose and long strong
          limbs with sharp claws. They have a small tail, hidden by their fur.   p 
 p  A Koala’s front and rear paws each have five digits with
            sharp claws. Their hands have two opposable thumbs, much like a human’s
            thumb, and three fingers, which help them with climbing and gripping
            tree branches. Two toes on their rear feet are joined together to
            form a ‘grooming claw’ useful for removing tics and combing
            their fur. The big toe doesn’t have a claw.   p 
 p  Koalas vary in size and colour depending on where they live in
            Australia. Koalas living in the southern parts have adapted to the
            colder climate. They are larger and have thicker, grey coloured fur.
            Koalas from the warmer northern areas are more a browny colour and
            smaller.   p 
 p  Koalas reach a maximum length of about 24 – 34 inches (60 – 85cm).
            An adult male koala can weigh between 17 – 30 pounds ( 8-14
            kilograms) and a female between 13 – 25 pounds (6 - 11 kilograms).
            They have a life span of between 12 and 15 years.   p 
 p   Koalas are found along the eastern coast of Australia, from the
          Atherton Tableland west of Cairns in Queensland, down through New South
          Wales, Victoria and South Australia . They also live on islands off
        the coast of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.   p 
 p  Their habitats range from tall eucalypt forests and low woodlands
            inland, to coastal island trees.  p 
 p   Koalas eat only leaves and bark from eucalyptus trees. There are
            over 600 types, or species of these trees, but Koalas only eat the
          leaves and bark from 12 of them.   p 
 p  Eucalyptus leaves are extremely poisonous to most animals but the
            Koala’s digestive system detoxifies the poison. Each Koala
            eats approximately 12 – 21 ounces (350 to 600 grams) of leaves
            a day. They prefer the ‘tip’ of the leaves, which is
            the juiciest and softest part of the leaf.   p 
 p  Koalas receive over 90% of their fluid intake from the Eucalyptus
            leaves. They only drink water when they are ill or when there is
            not enough moisture in the leaves.  p 
 p    span class="h3sans"  img src=".. .. images animals koala-sleeping.jpg" alt="Koala sleeping in tree" width="220" height="301" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left"   span Koals are mostly nocturnal. They spend up to 20 hours a day sleeping
          or resting in trees, curled up gripping the limbs with their feet.
          When they move around, they can leap from tree to tree as well as travelling
          longer distances on the ground. They walk with a slow akward gait,
        moving very slowly, but they can break into a run if threatened.   p 
 p  When travelling on the ground, they can be attacked by predators
            such as dogs, foxes and dingoes and they are also at risk of injury
            or death from cars.   p 
 p Koalas are very territorial and live in stable breeding groups.
            Each animal has its own ‘home trees’, and the area covered
            by these trees is called the koala’s ‘home range’.
            The size of each home range depends upon the sex, age and social
            position of the animal within the group. Koalas do not normally visit
            each other’s home trees, except for breeding.   p 
 p  Koalas are generally silent but can communicate with a wide variety
            of sounds including growls, grunts and a load bellow. The mating
            call of the male koalas can be heard for long distances during breeding
            season.  p 
 p  The Koala's very large nose is one of its most important features.
            It has a very highly developed sense of smell, which helps the animal
            tell what eucalyptus leaves are safe to eat.   p 
 p  Koalas have a very low metabolism, which conserves energy and helps
            with digestion of the fiborous eucalyptus leaves. They feed at any
            time of day, but usually in the cool of the night to conserve energy
            and moisture.   p 
 p  Eucalyptus leaves are poisonous to most animal and are not high
            in nutrients. Koalas have a special bacteria in their stomachs that
            breaks down the toxins in the eucalyptus oil. Koalas chew the eucalyptus
            leaves to a very fine paste before swallowing. Their hind gut (the
            caecum)
            is enlarged and contains bacteria which ferments the leaves and extract
            the maximum amount of nutrient from them.            p 
 p A baby Koala is called a joey. Koalas breed once a year
            between December and March (the Southern Hemisphere’s summer)
            and give birth to only one baby at a time. Gestation is 35 days.
            At birth, the joey is very small, about the size of a jelly bean.
            It measures less than 30 millimeteres in length and weighs less than
            1 gram. It has no ears or hair, and it can't see.          p 
 p As soon as the joey is born, it makes a long journey, crawling across
            its mother’s fur and into the pouch on her
            belly. A female koala's pouch opens near the bottom instead of at the top like a kangaroo pouch. The baby Koala attaches itself to one of two teats inside the pouch and the mother's powerful muscles hold the joey so it can't fall out. It stays hidden there for about six months, feeding on milk. During this time the joey grows ears, eyes and fur.            p 
 p At about 30 weeks, when the joey is ready to be weaned, the mother
            produces a special faeces from her anus called “Pap” which
            the joey licks from her fur. This is similar to a human baby being
            fed mushy food before going on to solids. The Pap is high in nutrients
            and micro-organisms from the mother’s own digestive system
          and helps the baby koala to begin to digest eucalyptus leaves.   p 
 p The joey leans out of the pouch to look around, and then starts to explore outside. It stays with
            its mother for another six months or so, riding on her back, and
            feeding on both milk and gum leaves. Weaning is complete at about
            12 months of age and after this, Koalas gradually become independent
            and survive on their own.  p 
 p  Once there were millions of Koalas, but in the early 20th century
            the animal was hunted almost to extinction. In the 1920s nearly eight
            million koalas were killed, largely for their fur.   p 
 p  Koalas require large areas of healthy forests that are connected
            together, and they will travel long distances along tree corridors
            in search of new territories and mates. When their habitats are destroyed,
            they have to travel further and more often. They also have to move
            along the ground more often, and so are at greater risk from predators
            and humans.   p 
 p  The most common causes of koala deaths are dog attacks and motor
            vehicle accidents. In recent years some colonies of koals have been
            hard hit by disease.   p 
 p  There are now many conservation and research programs to help protect
            the Koala and its habitat.  p
