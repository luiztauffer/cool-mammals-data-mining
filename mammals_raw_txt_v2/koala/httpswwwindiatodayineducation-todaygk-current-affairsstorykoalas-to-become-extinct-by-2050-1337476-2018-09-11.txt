 p Research conducted by the Nature Conservation Council (NCC) and WWF Australia has found that the koala habitat, which is the size of 14 football fields, is being bulldozed every day in one part of the New South Wales state since the government weakened the laws. This might lead to their extinction by 2050.  p 
 p Koalas in New South Wales and Queensland have been listed as vulnerable to extinction under national and state laws.  strong More than 5,000 hectares of koala habitat has been cleared in just one year in north-central NSW.  strong   p 
 p "The area where this habitat destruction has occurred is one of the most heavily cleared in the state, with only 6 per cent of forest remaining while an additional 11 per cent was in sparse woodlands," said NCC CEO Kate Smolski  p 
 p The report by WWF Australia and NCC used satellite images of northern NSW to assess land clearing and its impact on vulnerable and endangered species.  p 
 p The report was released on National Threatened Species Day which falls every year on September 7.  p

 p  strong 1.  strong  Since European colonization, koalas, which have been living in Australia for 25 million years, have lost their habitats as a result of urban, agricultural and mining development, climate change, and the commercialization of their skins until the 1930s.  p 
 p  strong 2.  strong  The state government in 2017 decided to repeal the Native Vegetation Act 2003, which prevented farmers from felling trees. The report concludes that this was likely the major reason behind the dramatic surge in the forest and woodland destruction in this known clearing hotspot.  p 
 p "The numbers are low, and everybody out there is telling us that koalas are dropping terribly," said Martin Taylor, a conservation biologist.  p 
 p  strong 3.  strong  The koalas are threatened by destruction of food and shelter trees and forest fragmentation, which exposes them to higher mortalities from vehicle strike, dog attacks, and stress.  p 
 p  strong 4.  strong  In some areas, koalas have also died due to Chlamydia, a bacterial infection that causes injuries to the genitals and eyes, causing infertility and blindness, slowly consuming them to death.  p 
 p  strong WWF Australia estimates there are likely less than 20,000 koalas left in NSW and at the current rate, they are on track to be extinct in the state by as early as 2050.  strong   p

 p Eucalyptus is one of Australia's most identifiable trees and is critically important to biodiversity and environmental sustainability. They are commercially Australia's most important native trees and are now the most planted hardwoods worldwide.  p
