 p class="x-p adoption-description text-center" At Koala we believe in improving habitats, inside and outside of your home. We do this through donations to wildlife conservation or by minimising consumption by creating simple, well-made products that are built to last and have a reduced environmental footprint. br Because after all, the world is our habitat; and it’s the only one we’ve got.  p 
 p class="x-p adoption-description text-center" data-v-4e082dd2 
      We've partnered with WWF to get to the heart of the problem.

          Due to ongoing habitat loss and human development, the koala is on the ropes. When you buy a koala mattress, you’re also saving real, live koalas. Your symbolic koala adoption not only supports sick and injured koalas, but also protects and restores koala habitat around Australia

          The warming climate in our Northern Great Barrier Reef is threatening the population of green turtles. When you buy a koala sofa, you're also helping fund critical research to prevent the extinction of this ancient marine animal.

        Yep, you read that right. When you buy a koala mattress or sofa, you're also adopting a koala or turtle through our partnership with WWF. Your adoption of our endangered friends helps save and protect their habitat. You'll receive an official certificate of adoption and a warm fuzzy feeling.

 p class="x-p adoption-info__text" data-v-1afba4a6 Our warming climate and increasing temperatures in the northern Great Barrier Reef are turning populations of marine turtles almost completely female. Koala is partnering with WWF-Australia, the Queensland government and the University of Queensland to undertake research to prevent this and possible population collapse.  p 
 p class="x-p adoption-info__text" data-v-1afba4a6 Binna Burra Koala Sanctuary is koala’s first project to revitalise critical koala habitat. It will form part of a wildlife corridor in Northern NSW to protect koalas in the area. So far we have planted over 7500 trees and we’re just getting started.  p
