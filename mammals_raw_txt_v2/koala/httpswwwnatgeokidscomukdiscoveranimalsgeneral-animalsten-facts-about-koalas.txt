 p style="text-align: justify;"  strong Ready for the lowdown on one  em seriously  em  cute creature? Then join National Geographic Kids as we check out ten fascinating koala facts!  strong   p 
 p style="text-align: justify;"  strong 1)  strong  Koalas are found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern  strong Australia  strong . They have grey fur with a cream-coloured chest, and strong, clawed feet, perfect for living in the branches of trees!  p 
 p  strong 2)  strong  Cuddly critters, koalas measure about  strong 60cm  strong  to strong  85cm  strong  long, and weigh about  strong 14kg  strong .  p 
 p  strong 3)  strong  Although you may have heard people call them koala ‘bears’, these awesome animals aren’t bears at all – they are in fact  em marsupials  em . A group of mammals, most marsupials have pouches where their newborns develop.  p 
 p  strong 4)  strong  When an infant koala – called a  strong joey  strong  – is born, it immediately climbs up to its mother’s pouch. Blind and earless, a joey uses its  strong strong sense of touch and smell  strong , as well as natural instinct, to find its way.  p 
 p  strong 5)  strong  A joey grows and develops in the pouch for about  strong six months  strong . Once strong enough, the youngster rides around on its mother’s back for a further six months, only using the pouch to feed.  p 
 p style="text-align: justify;"  strong 6)   strong Koala’s grow up to become big eaters, shifting up to  strong one kilogram of eucalyptus leaves  strong  in a day! They are fussy, too, and will select the most nutritious and tastiest leaves from the trees where they live.  p 
 p  strong 7)  strong  These magnificent mammals get their name form an Aboriginal strong *  strong  term meaning, ‘ strong no drink’  strong . It’s believed this is because koalas get almost all their moisture from the leaves they eat, and rarely drink water.  p 
 p  strong 8)  strong  But check this out – eucalyptus leaves are super tough  em and  em  poisonous! Luckily for koalas, they have a long digestive organ called a  strong cecum  strong  which allows them to break down the leaves unharmed.  p 
 p  strong 9)  strong  Enjoy having a snooze? Well so do our furry friends! Koalas don’t have much energy and, when not feasting on leaves, they spend their time dozing in the branches. Believe it or not, they can sleep for up to  strong 18 hours  strong  a day!  p 
 p  strong 10)  strong  Although these beautiful creatures are protected by law, and not classed as an endangered species, their habitat is under threat. Sadly, around  strong 80% of koala habitat has been lost  strong  to human homes, drought and forest fires.  p 
 p While you wait for it to be checked and approved why not to add
                a pre-selected message and a cool badge

 p Year 6 love koalas! We think that they are very fluffy and cute- but we do know that they can become threatened and dangerous. Year 6 would love to travel to Australia and meet these koalas i their natural habitats. We could go and visit them in zoos over here in the UK- England (and some of us have already met them.) Most of us here have never seen a koala in real life form, but are very close with them.
Thank you National Geographic Kids for sharing this information. We cant wait for more!!!  p 
 p Nice  p

 p i  love koalas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  p 
 p omg theyre lazy  p 
 p cool facts mates! supa groovy, i love kolas  p 
 p cool  p 
 p Since Im from Australia, I occasionally see them.
Its quite hard to see them as the eucaliptus trees are so tall in the forests!
There arent that may in the country, as animals - theyre my fav!!
If you go to Australia ( the Eastern Side), dont go thinking that your going to find one because you might not. Since the eucalyptus treres are so tall, the koalas prefer to be up high.
This gives you less of a chance to see them, but remember NEVER GIVE UP!
Bring biocluars if you want to look up high in the tree tops for them!
