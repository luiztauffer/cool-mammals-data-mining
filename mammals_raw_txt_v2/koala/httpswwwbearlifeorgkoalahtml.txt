It has gray to brown colored fur  with a white underbelly. It lazily makes it way through the tree  branches to eat, sleep, and nurse its young. Spending most  of its lifecycle in the trees, it only descends to the ground if  necessary. Koalas are adored by many for their small size and  cartoon-like features. The Koala is a marsupial.  p 
 p  Mothers give  birth and raise only one baby koala at time. During the mothers  lifecycle she will produce up to six cubs. A newborn kaola baby is  called a “joey” and does not resemble an adult since it is born blind  with undeveloped features. A joey measures under one inch in length.  p 
 p  Upon birth the joey makes its way to the mother’s pouch and attaches  itself inside. It then develops its eyes, legs, and fur. In fact it  lives in the mother’s pouch for about six months. When it emerges from  the pouch it takes on the familiar cute and cuddly appearance of an  adult.   p 
 p  Eventually the baby koala transfers itself to the  mother’s back to hitch a free ride. It continues to nurse off the  mother’s milk for up to a year and eats eucalyptus leaves. Some baby  koalas want to use the safety of the pouch longer than necessary but  their size prohibits them from climbing back inside. When the next joey  is born it is time for last season’s baby to say goodbye.  p 
 p  Eucalyptus leaves is the only food koalas eat. Although the leaves are  poisonous to most animals, they have special bacteria that live in  their stomachs to break down and digest them. Their diet includes up to  one pound of leaves a day.  p 
 p  The koala has special teeth adapted  for their eucalyptus diet. The majority of their front and back teeth  act like scissors to chop the leaves into pieces suitable for  digestion. Eucalyptus leaves have a fair amount of moisture hence  koalas seldom drink water.  p 
 p  Plant specie information about  eucalyptus trees indicate there are many different varieties in the  wild. In fact each koala is particular about what kind they will eat.  Baby koalas acquire their taste for specific varieties by adulthood.  One of the main reasons koalas are endangered in some areas is the  destruction of native eucalyptus forest habitats.  p 
 p  Eucalyptus  leaves are high in fiber and low in nutrients. In addition to eating  large amounts, koalas are able to survive on their diet since they have  a slow metabolic system to conserve nutrients and energy. Since they  have no natural predators in Australia, this adaptation is not to their  disadvantage.   p 
 p  The koala’s habitat is in the country of Australia. Their range is  between the eastern and southern parts of the country. Information  facts about their population and habitat vary, but they live mainly in  the Australian states of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia,  and Victoria.   p 
 p  Although their habitat is in four states of  Australia, they live in fragmented territories separated by various man  made development activities. Their entire life cycle is restricted by  these artificial borders. Their habitat continues to decline as human  populations demand more land resources, endangering some koalas. Human  pet predators are an additional threat. Baby koalas in particular are  vulnerable.  p 
 p  Although the koala does not live in the United States, it is in fact  listed under the United States Endangered Species Act as threatened. In  its native country of Australia there is no uniform status definition.  Their status is dependent on each particular region of each Australian  state, which in turn is dependent on population and habitat  information. Some areas list it as vulnerable or rare, yet others list  it as common.   p 
 p  img style="border: 0pt none ; margin: 3px 12px 3px 0px;" src="images koala-endangered.jpg" alt="Koala bear in tree to avoid preditors" width="135" height="108" align="left" title="Koala bear endangered" Although it has no natural predators, the areas where it is at risk is  highest where the koala’s habitat has been destroyed and or poaching  and hunting is prevalent. In areas where they are common there is a  danger of over feeding since they all eat the same kind of plant.   p 
 p  Overall stress on the livelihood of these animals is increasing as  threats caused by man made activities shrink and impact their natural  environment. Conservation measures will ultimately be necessary to save  their habitat and population. Although they have unique adaptations for  living in their habitat of eucalyptus forests, wildlife in general  cannot adapt as fast as the rapid changes brought on by mankind.  p 
 p  Although they are cute, cuddly, and baby like, wild Koalas should not  be approached or handled. Information on koala attacks are very rare  and they are not considered dangerous. Still, wild animals in general  should be respected from a distance. They do have sharp claws and teeth  and can use them if necessary.  p 
 p  In  Australia koalas that live in the wild have no natural predators. They  are in fact at the top of the food chain in their habitat. Large birds  such as owls have been known to prey on baby koalas, although such  information is scarce. By definition koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves,  they do not prey on other animals.  p
