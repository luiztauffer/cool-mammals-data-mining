 p WASHINGTON (CIRCA via MOBIUS.LAB) — Koalas, the cute teddy bear lookalikes, are marsupials native to  span class="Enhancement"  span class="Enhancement-item"  a class="Link" href="https:  www.circa.com topic australia" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0" Australia  a   span   span . In less than a decade, koalas have had a population decline of 90 percent.  p 
 p Wildlife researchers estimate that there are between 2,000 and 8,000 koalas in the wild. Monitoring the number of koalas in their habitat has proven difficult because of their complex  span class="Enhancement"  span class="Enhancement-item"  a class="Link" href="https:  www.circa.com topic environment" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0" environment  a   span   span ; koalas eat eucalyptus leaves and live under canopies of eucalyptus trees in forests.  p
