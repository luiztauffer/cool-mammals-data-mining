 p A koala habitat 50 per cent larger than the Royal National Park has been destroyed by logging, according to a new conservation report.  p 
 p The report titled Clearing Koalas Away by conservationist Dailan Pugh, says more than 23,000 hectares of koala habitat near Coffs Harbour has been "virtually cleared".  p 
 p "They're hitting them really hard. We're looking at about 40 per cent of koala habitat in state forests," he said.  p 
 p "Their own modelling is showing these areas are important but they're ignoring that."  p 
 p Mr Pugh, an environmentalist for over 40 years, sourced the forestry data under freedom of information (FOI) legislation, in a bid to measure logging against known koala habitats.  p 
 p Last year, then-environment minister Mark Speakman admitted "intensive harvesting" on the North Coast was "not consistent" with regulations, and said the Environment Protection Authority was investigating.   p 
 p An EPA spokesperson declined to answer questions, but said "current rules are over 15 years old and lack clarity in important areas, including intensive harvesting".  p 
 p Recent studies suggest less than 9,000 koalas survive on the North Coast, a 50 per cent decline in the past 20 years.   p 
 p Habitat loss is widely acknowledged as a driver of the decline.  p 
 p    p 
 p Mr Pugh said a sustainable logging method called "single-tree selection" is being misused by Forestry Corporation.   p 
 p Single-tree selection permits the selective harvest of just 40 per cent of eucalypts trees in a logging zone â€” leaving 60 per cent of trees as off-limits.  p 
 p But the off-limits status is temporary, and evidence shows these trees are heavily logged in later operations.   p 
 p The reports highlights examples like Kerewong State Forest, with photos showing the heavy clearing of a mapped koala habitat.  p 
 p    p 
 p Forestry data and satellite maps show the neighbouring off-limits area was itself heavily logged in 2009, removing feed-trees and destroying habitat.  p 
 p Mr Pugh claimed the practice breached environmental laws.  p 
 p "It's definitely clear-felling and it's totally illegal," he said.  p 
 p "They're meant to retain 60 per cent of the area, and they're in there taking 80 to 90 per cent without doubt."  p 
 p A spokesperson for Environment Minister Gabrielle Upton said she was committed to "stabilise and ultimately increase the numbers of koalas" and is "developing a whole-of-government koala strategy" to complement its conservation work.  p
