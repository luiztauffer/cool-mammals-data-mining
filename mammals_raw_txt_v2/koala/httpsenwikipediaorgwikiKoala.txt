The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions, inhabiting  a href=" wiki Queensland" title="Queensland" Queensland  a ,  a href=" wiki New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales" New South Wales  a ,  a href=" wiki Victoria_(Australia)" title="Victoria (Australia)" Victoria  a , and  a href=" wiki South_Australia" title="South Australia" South Australia  a . It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb).  a href=" wiki Pelage" class="mw-redirect" title="Pelage" Pelage  a  colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south. These populations possibly are separate  a href=" wiki Subspecies" title="Subspecies" subspecies  a , but this is disputed.
  p 
 p Koalas typically inhabit open  a href=" wiki Eucalypt" title="Eucalypt" eucalypt  a  woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely  a href=" wiki Sedentary_lifestyle" title="Sedentary lifestyle" sedentary  a  and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and  a href=" wiki Maternal_bond" title="Maternal bond" bonding  a  exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males  a href=" wiki Animal_communication" title="Animal communication" communicate  a  with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from  a href=" wiki Scent_gland" title="Scent gland" scent glands  a  located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers'  a href=" wiki Pouch_(marsupial)" title="Pouch (marsupial)" pouches  a , where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as  a href=" wiki Marsupial#Early_development" title="Marsupial" joeys  a , are fully  a href=" wiki Weaning" title="Weaning" weaned  a  around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various  a href=" wiki Pathogen" title="Pathogen" pathogens  a , such as  a href=" wiki Chlamydiaceae" title="Chlamydiaceae" Chlamydiaceae  a  bacteria and the  a href=" wiki Koala_retrovirus" title="Koala retrovirus" koala retrovirus  a , as well as by  a href=" wiki Bushfire" class="mw-redirect" title="Bushfire" bushfires  a  and droughts.

The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist  a href=" wiki George_Perry_(naturalist)" title="George Perry (naturalist)" George Perry  a . Botanist  a href=" wiki Robert_Brown_(Scottish_botanist_from_Montrose)" class="mw-redirect" title="Robert Brown (Scottish botanist from Montrose)" Robert Brown  a  wrote the first detailed scientific  a href=" wiki Species_description" title="Species description" description  a  of the koala in 1814, although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular artist  a href=" wiki John_Gould" title="John Gould" John Gould  a  illustrated and described the koala, introducing the species to the general British public. Further details about the animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists. Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised worldwide as a  a href=" wiki National_symbols_of_Australia" title="National symbols of Australia" symbol of Australia  a .
