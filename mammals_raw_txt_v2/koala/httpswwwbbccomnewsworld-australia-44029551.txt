 p class="story-body__introduction" The state of New South Wales in Australia (NSW) is to spend A$45m ($34m; Â£25m) protecting one of its most iconic creatures - the koala.   p 
 p The money will be used to establish forest reserves and build a hospital to care for the sick and injured animals.  p 
 p There will also be adjustments to roadkill hotspots as many koalas are killed by cars.  p 
 p The koala's decline has been blamed on habitat loss, dog attacks and climate change.  p 
 p Almost 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of state forest will become a koala habitat, for the animals to breed freely.  p

 p The koala population has dropped by about 26% over the past two decades in NSW, according to studies.  p 
 p "We know that there are around 36,000 koalas left in the state, but we don't know that for sure," NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.  p 
 p "It would be such a shame if this nationally iconic marsupial did not have its future secured."  p 
 p The Australian Koala Foundation estimates there may be as few as 43,000 koalas left in the wild, down from a population believed to have numbered more than 10 million prior to the European settlement of the continent in the 18th Century.  p
