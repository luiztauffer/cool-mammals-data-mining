 p It is no wonder everyone who comes to Australia wants a koala cuddle! Internationally, the koala, is Australia’s most recognised animal. Amazingly cute, mysterious and quite unique in its looks, the koala has a famous reputation for many reasons.  p 
 p We are quite lucky at Wildlife Habitat, being one of the few places in the world where our guests are allowed to hold the koala during the souvenir photo experience.  p 
 p It is an experience we enjoy; it is not often you are blessed with a job where you make dreams come true! We love to see the smiles on the faces of visitors when they first feel the soft fur and smell the delicious eucalyptus scent.  a href="https:  www.wildlifehabitat.com.au port-douglas-experiences feature-creature-photos " target="_blank"  strong Souvenir photos with our resident koalas are available 4 times throughout the day.  strong   a   p 
 p Koala’s do have a great union though. They are only allowed to work 30 minutes a day, 3 days in a row. They need the other 23.5 hours to do important work – like sleeping, eating and digesting their food. Hence, the cuddle is quick, the souvenir photo is your lasting memory of this special moment.  p 
 p To spend more interactive time with one of our resident koalas, we suggest you opt for our private tour  strong  a href="https:  www.wildlifehabitat.com.au port-douglas-experiences your-private-wildlife-tour " target="_blank" YOUR Wildlife Habitat  a   strong , with opportunities to interact with the koala in its enclosure under the supervision of your Wildlife Keeper guide.  p

 p The Queensland Koala is listed as Vulnerable on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 threatened species list.  p 
 p In May 2015, the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection decided to list the Queensland Koala as vulnerable in the state; federally it was listed in 2012.  p 
 p By raising the status of the Queensland Koala, the QLD and Federal governments, are ensuring there are necessary plans and schemes in place to ensure the koala remains with us and is not lost forever like the Tasmanian Tiger.  p 
 p  strong Main threats:  strong   p 
 p There are many national and local area ‘Save the Koala’ conservation groups where you can contribute funds or your time towards the conservation of the koala.  p 
 p Breeding occurs during summer, most females only produce one joey per year. The gestation period in the womb is very short – about 35 days. The joey will make its way to the pouch attaching to the mother’s nipple. They will remain in the pouch for up to 8 months.  p 
 p During weaning, the joey will be feed on partially digested eucalyptus leaf called ‘pap’ that comes from the mother’s digestive system, but it is not poo! In the pap the mother passes on micro-organisms which will allow the joey to eat eucalyptus leaves.  p 
 p Our sister zoo  a href="http:  www.rainforest.com.au experiences koala-wildlife-park " target="_blank" Rainforestation Nature Park  a  in Kuranda has an active koala breeding program and welcomed 3 koala joeys into our koala population last year. Including little  a href="https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=uqncJ9Z9SsE" target="_blank" BonBon  a , who is without a doubt the cutest koala joey born in 2015! Koala cuddles are also available throughout the day at our sister zoos Rainforestation Nature Park and  a href="http:  cairnszoom.com.au " target="_blank" Cairns ZOOM and Wildlife Dome  a .  p 
 p The best time to see our koala’s is during our Feature Creature or Koala Souvenir Photo times, or during our 2.40pm Daily Koala feeding presentation. Everyone wakes up for food!  p 
 p We understand the Koala Cuddle experience is very important to all our guests and we endeavour to do everything to make this moment special. We welcome you to share your memories on our  a href="https:  www.facebook.com PortDouglasWildlife ?ref=settings" Facebook page.  a   p
