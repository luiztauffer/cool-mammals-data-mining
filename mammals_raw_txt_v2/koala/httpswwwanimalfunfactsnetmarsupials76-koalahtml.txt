 p Koalas are nocturnal marsupials living in the eucalyptus trees of Australia. Together with the  a href=" marsupials 79-red-kangaroo.html" kangaroos  a  they are Australia’s best known animal species.  p 
 p Koalas fill their belly with about 2,2 lb (1 kg) of eucalyptus leaves every day. The little teddy bears would not accept anything else on their plate. Yet, they are still rather picky. The animals only like 12 out of 300 different sorts of eucalyptus.  p

 p Some eucalyptus leaves are poisonous during springtime. Fortunately, koalas have a good sense of smell. After a short sniffing test they can tell which leaves are “good” and which are “bad”.  p 
 p Koalas sleep about 14 hours every day. Yet, this does not seem to be enough. They spend additional 4 - 5 hours relaxing, as they are mostly tired from foraging food for 4 - 5 hours.  p 
 p Koalas wiggle their ears when feeling stressed. Sometimes they even develop a nervous hiccup. Stress also has a negative impact on the weak immune system (the body’s defences) of the koalas.  p

 p Koala is a word from the language of the Australian aborigines and means „doesn’t drink”. This is in fact true, because koalas exclusively take up the water contained in the eucalyptus leaves.  p 
 p It takes 35 days until a koala baby is born. At the time of its birth it measures only about 0.78 inch (2 cm) and is rather helpless. It does not have a coat and cannot use its eyes yet.  p 
 p Instead of exploring the world, it crawls into its mother’s pouch directly after its birth. After 22 weeks it opens its eyes and leaves the pouch after about 6 months.  p

 p Once the koala baby is strong enough to climb out of the pouch, this does not mean that the sweet life is coming to an end. Now the little koala can explore the world on its mother’s back for another 6 months.  p
