  p 
 p  font color="#800040" The name "Koala" is derived from the Aboriginal
dialect of eastern New South Wales. Koalas were very important to the Aborigines
and actually are part of several common myths. There is a common belief
that they can even cause droughts. Today they are important in Australia
for tourism reasons and are often called the "Animal Ambassadors" of Australia.
They are now popular animals all over the world and reside in zoos in many
countries. However, many of their admirers don't really know much about
them or how they live. They are often called "bears" because of their stubby
little tails and their stocky builds, but they are actually unrelated to
bears; they are marsupials. Australia is well known for its many marsupial
species, probably a result of its isolation in its evolutionary history.
Marsupials completely dominated Australia's fauna until several placental
mammals were brought by the Europeans that settled there. Koalas, as with
all marsupials, have a pouch in which their young develop. They usually
only produce a single young each time they give birth. Koalas are the sole
member of the family Phascolarctidae. They are an average of 17.4 lbs for
females and 14.3 lbs for males. They have thick gray fur, fluffy ears with
white hair, and a big black nose. The average lifespan of a koala varies,
but is about 13-18 years.  font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040" Koalas are solitary animals and reside primarily
in trees where they sleep and eat. They are very picky eaters and prefer
several different eucalyptus species almost exclusively, though they occasionally
eat other varieties of leaves. Because they are such solitary and relatively
inactive animals, any form of stress on their environment affects them
greatly. Tourism and Urbanization are some of these factors.  font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040"  font size="+2" THE THREAT  font   font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040" The koalas today are under the threat of becoming
endangered in Australia if something is not done to stop the rapid decline
they are experiencing. They are listed as vulnerable, but not as an endangered
species in Australia's Endangered Species Act. They therefore do not receive
all the protection that they need and the National government is slow in
taking steps to protect them.  a href="http:  gurukul.ucc.american.edu ted koala.htm" Koalas
are big business  a  in Australia and bring in a lot of capital every year
in the country. Koala's are very sensitive to their environment and die
easily. With the increases in tourism and urbanization in Australia, they
and their habitats are under tremendous stress. Every year, 11,000 koalas
are estimated to be killed by cars. They also die as a result of dog attacks
and bacterial diseases. They face the constant destruction of their habitat
and food, the eucalyptus trees. There were many bushfires in '94 and '95
with the drought that happened in Australia, further straining the diminishing
koala habitat.  a href="http:  www.akfkoala.gil.com.au akfmain.html" The
Australian Koala Foundation  a  has estimated that there are only 40,000
to 80,000 koalas left today, down from around 400,000 in the early 1980's
( a href="http:  www2.jps.net ~jpeng Koala sci_am.html" Broken Dreamtime
'95  a ). It is estimated that approximately  a href="http:  www.akfkoala.gil.com.au khamed.html" eighty
percent of the koala's natural habitat has been destroyed  a , and much
of the remaining percent is on private land. Individual owners have to
make decisions to protect the trees and food the koalas require to survive,
as well as watch for koalas when they drive, and keep their dogs contained.  font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040"  font size="+2" WHAT IS BEING DONE  font   font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040" Many conservation groups in Australia have the
goal of educating the public about how to individually prevent further
loss of koalas right where they are. Efforts are being made to encourage
the planting of koala food trees, looking out for koalas, keeping dogs
contained, and advocating work to prevent further destruction of koala
habitat. The koalas food and shelter must be protected if it is to have
the chance to thrive again.  font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040" One thing that one private group organized is
the  a href="http:  www2.jps.net ~jpeng Koala sci_am.html" Koala Hospital  a 
in New South Wales. The hospital helps save about 170 koalas each year,
suffering from injuries or diseases, usually a result of the urbanization
so close to their homes. The hospital survives mostly on volunteer labor
and support.  font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040" Another project that is more conceptual and long
term is the Australian Koala Foundation's " a href="http:  www.akfkoala.gil.com.au khamed.html" Koala
Habitat Atlas  a " project. The project is the biggest push the Foundation
is attempting to promote conservation of the koala. The researchers "use
GIS technology to identify, map and rank koala habitat and to give land-use
planners this vital information in a practical format." Because of the
great amount of destruction that has already occurred, the project is attempting
to evaluate what is left, what the koalas need to live on, and how to get
the information out to those who can do something about it. Koalas are
very habitat specific because they require specific varieties of eucalyptus
trees, so land-use planning is the only way to really ensure their survival.
Decisions about land use planning occur mostly on the local level of government,
though the federal and state governments can have a large impact as well.
The AKF would like to instill a feeling of stewardship among the people
of Australia and the rest of the world to see that we don't abuse any more
of the koala's resources.  font 
  p 
 p  font color="#800040"  a href="http:  www.akfkoala.gil.com.au akfmain.html" The
Australian Koala Foundation  a  also sponsors "Save the Koala Month" and
"Save the Koala Day." These two events occur in July, with the Day on the
31st. This is to encourage awareness around the world of the plight of
the koala and encourage people to support efforts to save the popular and
beautiful creature.  font

  p 
 p  font color="#800040"  a href="http:  www.awt.com.au koala" Kangaroo
Island Koala Reserve  a : A current issue relating to the situation of
the koalas in Australia is the proposed translocation of koalas from kangaroo
island, which is overpopulated, to the depleted koala habitat in New South
Wales. This project is supported by the Australian Geographic Society but
opposed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of Australia.
NPWS favors the sterilization of the koalas on kangaroo island to prevent
overpopulation, rather than transferring them. The project is headed by
George Wilson, who hopes to transfer the animals and set up a colony by
the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan Rivers in NSW. It is a favorable location
and a similar transfer 25 years ago succeeded as the animals have continued
to breed and thrive there. You can write, to show your support for the
project and express your desire to see the animals transferred rather than
sterilized, to:  font
