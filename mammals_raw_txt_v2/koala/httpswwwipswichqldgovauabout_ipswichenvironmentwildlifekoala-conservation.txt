 p  strong    strong The koala is one of Australia's most loved and iconic animals, but did you know that their existence is under threat in Queensland? Ipswich City Council has taken the steps to ensure our koala populations are preserved for future generations through the Koala Conservation Plan, however we still need your help to ensure koalas in Ipswich flourish. You can discover more information about how you can do your part to help on this page.  p 
 p The Koala Conservation and Habitat Management Plan sets an aim to protect, enhance, manage and increase koala habitat across Ipswich. Koala habitat extends across most of Ipswich, giving koalas a significant local profile and allowing them to be used as a flagship species for broader biodiversity outcomes.  p 
 p Council has more than 6,500 hectares of eucalypt and other native forest purchased and managed for the purpose of conservation which forms Council’s Natural Area Estate (NAE) network. The NAE can provide a safe haven for koalas and other species, away from the threat of urban development or other land use pressure. In Ipswich there are also a number of private and publically owned protected areas, including:  p 
 p Protecting and managing koala habitat on private land is equally important. Council offers landholders various incentives to achieve this. Council currently offers six types of partnerships to landholders including the Koala Conservation Agreement (KCA). The KCA offers support for koalas within Ipswich and is available to landholders whose property has suitable habitat for koalas, or potential to restore habitat to support koalas (&gt;1 ha).  p 
 p More information about  a title="Landholder Partnerships" href="https:  www.ipswich.qld.gov.au about_ipswich environment landholder_partnerships" target="_blank" Landholder Partnerships  a   p 
 p Koala populations also face a range of threats across the Ipswich LGA including:  p 
 p The Ipswich area is home to a population of koalas.  They are seen in our local bushland reserves, large conservation estates, and parks.  Residents are also privileged to be able to observe koalas in their own backyards.  br  br  There are a few simple actions that can ensure your backyard is a safe place for koalas to visit:  p 
 p Koalas have a specialised diet and mainly feed on eucalyptus leaves.  You can make your backyard koala friendly by retaining any food trees and also by planting the following trees which are available through Councils  a href="https:  www.ipswich.qld.gov.au residents healthy_lifestyle gardens" Free Plant Program  a :  p 
 p  strong Note  strong : Stock subject to availability.  p 
 p Koalas prefer to move in and through trees rather than along the ground.  Plant trees at a distance of 2m from each other so that koalas can move easily and safely from tree to tree across adjoining branches.  p 
 p Koalas are easily disturbed and can become stressed.  It is better to watch any koalas in your backyard from a distance such as your veranda.  Keep a pair of binoculars handy so that you can use them to see the koala "up close".  Remember that if the koala feels safe it is more likely to visit your area again.  p 
 p Koalas living in urban areas often face several obstacles during their nightly movements.  In our suburban areas one of the biggest problems is fencing.  Without too much effort or cost, we can assist koalas to move freely and provide them with a quick escape.  p 
 p Some tips for koala friendly fencing include:  p 
 p These fences are well suited to koalas but not necessarily to the ground dwellers such as bandicoots and wallabies.  If these animals are in your area, a fence that allows easy access for all fauna is one that has a 30cm gap from the ground to the bottom rail, chain or post of the fence.  p 
 p Even though koalas can swim, they cannot get out of pools using steps. Make your pool koala safe by attaching a thick rope to a floating device, for example, an empty plastic drink bottle.  Koalas can use this as a way to climb out if they fall in. Alternatively, place an escape board where a koala can easily reach it and climb out of the pool.  p 
 p Dogs will naturally defend their territory from intruders, including a koala.  One of the reasons people keep dogs is to increase their security, especially at night. However this is the time when koalas are most active. Even by playing with a koala dogs can cause serious injury and even death as a koala has soft fragile skin and minimal defence ability.  br  There are some simple tips to ensure that your home and family are kept safe at night whilst allowing koalas to be safe in your yard.  Tie your dog away from any trees, ensuring they have plenty of shade, shelter and water.  Alternatively, keep them locked inside at night, either inside your house or in an enclosed verandah or even the garage. Your dog will also provide better protection being close to your home as they will still pick up noises and you will easily hear them bark.  p
