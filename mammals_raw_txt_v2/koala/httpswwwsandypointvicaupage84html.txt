 p class="Wp-wp-wp-normal-p-p-P"  span class="normal-c-c-C" The Sandy Point community are working to manage and protect local wildlife. The WHiSPA
    project is about protecting our native wildlife and improving their natural habitat
    in and around Sandy Point.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-wp-normal-p-p-P"  span class="normal-c-c-C" One of the local species the community is working to manage and protect are koalas.
    Koalas are a local icon and are much loved by the local community and visitors alike.
    However, the health and future viability of the population of koalas at Sandy Point
    is a serious community concern. It is a community priority to protect and manage
    the local koala population to ensure that it remains healthy and sustainable into
    the future.  span   p

 p class="Wp-Body-P"  span class="Body-C-C0" Sandy Point Community Koala Action Project  span   p 
 p class="Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C" One of the projects run by the WHiSPA group is the   span  span class="Normal-C-C0" Sandy Point Community Koala Action
    Project.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-wp-normal-p-p-P"  span class="normal-c-c-C" This project is addressing issues facing the local koala population through:  span   p 
 p class="Normal-P-P0"  span class="Normal-C" 1. Collecting information to help understand the situation of our koalas  span   p 
 p class="Normal-P-P0"  span class="Normal-C" 2. Involving community in looking after koalas  span   p 
 p class="Normal-P-P0"  span class="Normal-C" 3. Restoring and revegetating areas for healthy and connected koala habitat  span   p 
 p class="Normal-P-P0"  span class="Normal-C" 4. Creating a community action plan for managing koalas long term.  span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C1" This project is funded with the support  br of the Victoria State Government.   span   p 
 p class="Body-P"  span class="Body-C-C1" Sandy Point Koalas  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P-P0"  span class="body-c-c-c-C" Sandy Point has a well-established population of koalas that live within the township
    as well as in the bush surrounding it. You may see koalas anywhere in Sandy Point,
    mainly in their preferred food source, manna gums. Two examples of this tree are
    growing at the end of the road to Shallow Inlet, just where the sealed road changes
    into gravel. Often a koala can be seen in one of these trees.  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P-P0"  span class="body-c-c-c-C" Koalas tend to be most active and forage for food at night. During the daytime they
    tend to sleep high up in a tree. You may hear the males vocalising, especially at
    night when they are on the move.  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P-P0"  span class="wp-body-p-p-C" Koalas and mange  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P-P0"  span class="body-c-c-c-C" Recently there has also been a problem with mange, which has resulted in 15 koalas
    having to be euthanised over 2016 17. Mange is an infestation of the mange mite which
    burrows under the skin of an animal depositing its eggs and causing intense discomfort.
     If left untreated it will lead to a slow and agonising death for the animal.  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P-P0"  span class="body-c-c-c-C" If you see a koala acting strangely, wandering around in daylight hours, or looking
    at all mangy, please let one of the contacts listed below know. They will arrange
    for the animal to be picked up by a wildlife carer and treatment to be started immediately.
    Apparently time really counts for the successful treatment of this disease.  span   p 
 p class="Body-P-P0"  span class="body-c-c-c-C" Dogs running free around Sandy Point have also been the cause of many koala deaths
    so please keep your dogs on a leash and do not let them out at night unsupervised.
    That way, we can all continue to enjoy the company of our resident koala population.  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-P"  span class="body-c-c-c-c-C" Wombats and mange  span   p 
 p class="Pa1-P"  span class="body-c-c-c-c-C-C0" Wombats and even possums can also contract mange. Wombats are in fact probably the
    main source of infection for koalas. If you see a mangey wombat please call one of
    the contacts below as they too can be treated. For more information about wombats
    and mange go to the Mange Management website.  a href="http:  mangemanagement.org.au " target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" http:  mangemanagement.org.au   a   span   p

 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C2" We've now set up a phone list of people who've volunteered to help with transporting
    sick or injured animals from or near Sandy Point to a local wildlife shelter. Thanks
    to those who have already put their hands up for this.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C2" If you'd also like to be included on this list please contact Di on 0437 392 277.
    This is purely for transporting animals, not for catching them.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C2" We are currently organising for another group of people to attend a training course
    run by Wildlife Victoria to learn how to safely catch sick and injured wildlife.

 p class="wp-body-p-p-P"  span class="body-c-c0-c-C" A guide to living with koalas in Sandy Point  span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="body-c-c-c-c-C-C1" We’ve created a brochure containing information about living with koalas in Sandy
    Point, including explaining the threats, tips for koala-friendly yards and what (and
    when) to plant, what to do if you find a sick or injured koala, and wildlife carer
    contact details. This is available from the General Store or Community Centre, or
    you can  a href="Sandy%20Point_Koala%20Brochure_6%20panels_FINAL_151217_web%20(1).pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" download a web version of the brochure  a  (PDF 3581 KB).  span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-normal-p-P"  span class="body-c-c-c-c-C-C1"  Please help us share these around. We encourage local real estate agents   landlords
    to provide these to guests in holiday homes - please get in touch if you would like
    hard copies.  span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-normal-p-P"  span class="wp-normal-p-C" Revegetation and wildlife corridors  span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C4" Want to plant some coastal manna gums in your yard?  span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C2" We're giving away coastal manna gums to people with properties in Sandy Point to
    plant in their yards.  span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C2" Please fill out  a href="https:  goo.gl forms xXV6PyipGe115Xas2" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" this online form  a   to request individual koala trees (coastal manna
    gums) for planting (including guards).   span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-normal-p-P"  span class="normal-c-c2-C" If you’ve already filled out a form, hold tight and we’ll contact you sometime soon
    about collecting the trees. We will then also be able to answer any questions you
    may have about this.    span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P"  span class="wp-body-p-p-C-C0" Funding for wildlife corridors br   span  span class="wp-body-p-p-C-C1" Project funding is currently available for wildlife
    corridors on properties in and around Sandy Point. The aim of this project is to
    help koalas and other native animals move around freely, and to increase the habitat
    available to them. To do this we’re asking landowners to help restore   improve and
    protect existing bush on their properties, and to create new wildlife corridors that
    connect up patches of existing bush.  span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C2" Applications for this have now closed.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C-C4" Tree Planting days  span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-normal-p-P"  span class="wp-normal-p-C-C0" A vry successful tree planting day was held on Sunday 23 September, with 33 people
    coming along to help plant trees in the coastal reserve to provide future food for
    koalas. With their help we planted over 50 manna gums, with guards to protect them
    from rabbits, wallabies and kangaroos as well as koalas while they are maturing.
     As the weather is warming up, there will not be any more tree planting days this
    year. We’ll let you know when next year’s tree planting days will occur. Thanks to
    all those who came along on the day.   span   p

 p class="Wp-wp-normal-p-p-P"  span class="normal-c-c0-c-C" The first ever Sandy Point Koala Count was held on Sunday 24th September 2017 and
    was enthusiastically supported by the community. See the results here:  a href="Sandy%20Point%20koala%20count%2024%20Sept%202017.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline;" Sandy Point
    Koala Count Sept 2017 Results  a   span  span class="normal-c-c0-c-c2-C"  (PDF 4.50 MB).   span  span class="normal-c-c0-c-C" A special thanks to Federation Uni staff
    and student Hannah Buys, who made the koala count possible by developing a handbook
    and instructions specifically for a Sandy Point koala count.   span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P"  span class="normal-c-c0-c-C" We have also been mapping koala habitat in and around Sandy Point – an online map
    will be available here soon.  span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P"  span class="body-c-c0-c-C" Community Action Planning Session:  span  span class="normal-c-c-C-C2"    span  span class="normal-c-c-C-C0" 7 April 2018  span   p 
 p class="Wp-wp-wp-normal-p-p-P"  span class="wp-wp-normal-p-p-C" We had a productive community planning session  - thanks to all who came and contributed
    their ideas and knowledge.   span  span class="wp-wp-normal-p-p-C-C0" It was a great turnout of around 35 folks.    span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C" Information was shared about the koala project by Cassie Wright from   span  span class="Normal-C-C0" NatureMatters  span  span class="Normal-C" 
    and project coordinator Caitlin Pilkington, who gave an update on the project and
    shared the results of the community koala count and other surveys: habitat mapping
    and scat sampling.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C" We then held an action planning session where we worked together on community actions
    to support koalas, with lots of people putting up their hands to help. The plan will
    be finalised soon.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C" And we were lucky enough to have local wildlife carers Sue Moore and Kylie Laing
    come along to share their experiences, and Sue again gave a really interesting presentation
    about her work with koalas.   span   p 
 p class="Wp-Normal-P"  span class="Normal-C" We had some really great discussions about wildlife care: the wildlife carers told
    us that they need help in catching and transporting sick animals. We had lots of
    people volunteer to help out with this, and have since set up a phone list and register
    of people to help (see more info below).   span   p 
 p class="wp-body-p-p-P"  span class="body-c-c0-c-C-C0" A Community Action Plan is currently being finalised – email us for details at  a href="mailto:sandypointkoalas@gmail.com" style="text-decoration:underline;" sandypointkoalas@gmail.com  a   span   p
