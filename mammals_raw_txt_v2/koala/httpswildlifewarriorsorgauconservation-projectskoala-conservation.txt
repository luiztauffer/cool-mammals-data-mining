 p class="stage-3-p lead-subheader" style="font-size: 19px !important;" Urbanisation of once wild bushland areas threatens the wild koala populations. Koalas rely on eucalyptus trees for food, shelter and safety against predators. Since European settlement, Australia has lost a staggering 80% of koala habitat to deforestation. As their trees disappear, so do the koalas.  p 
 p class="stage-3-p lead-subheader" style="font-size: 19px !important;" Our increasingly man-made world introduces new threats for koalas. As housing estates and busy roads encroach into koala habitat, they're left vulnerable to road accidents, dog attacks and an imminent spread of life-threatening diseases such as chlamydia. Today, koala numbers are at an all-time low.  p

The sexually transmitted disease frequently leads to blindness, severe bladder inflammation, infertility and death. More than 50% of the koalas admitted to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital are infected with disease and in desperate need of treatment.  p

Through developing advanced diagnostics, treatment strategies and long-term solutions, experts are determined to help koala populations thrive once more.
