 p We know from  a href="http:  www.publish.csiro.au book 7418 " target="_blank" historical accounts  a  that at the time of European settlement koalas were abundant on the east coast of Australia. Hunting, coupled with rapid habitat loss and fragmentation via land clearing and urban development, has resulted in dramatic falls in koala numbers.  span id="more-2409"   span  a href="http:  www.sciencedirect.com science article pii S0006320715301130" target="_blank" Almost every population on the east coast is in decline  a . In the Bega Valley in southern NSW, a population that used to support a pelt industry in the late 19th century has been reduced to under 100 due to  a href="http:  dx.doi.org 10.1071 WR13054" target="_blank" land clearing, intensive logging and climate change  a . Now, people in NSW are lucky if they see a koala in the wild during their life!  p 
 p Most of the remaining high quality koala habitat lies in state forests and on private land where ongoing  a href="https:  npansw.org what-we-do our-work campaigns land-clearing " clearing of native vegetation  a  and  a href="https:  npansw.org what-we-do our-work campaigns end-native-forest-logging " intense, industrialised logging  a  is leading to the removal of vital food and habitat trees. It’s hard to believe that 200 years after settlement, we have still not taken decisive action to protect our favourite animal.  p 
 p We know that koalas like  a href="https:  www.researchgate.net profile William_Foley3 publication 7823574_Tree_use_by_Koalas_in_a_chemically_complex_landscape links 00b4953bab6134c2fe000000.pdf" target="_blank" larger trees  a ,  a href="http:  www.epa.nsw.gov.au resources forestagreements koala-habitat-mapping-pilot-160038.pdf" target="_blank" older forests and low disturbance  a  from fire and logging. So the solution to helping them is obvious! We need to stop logging and clearing in koala habitat. Why? Because protecting existing habitat is many times cheaper and more efficient than having to restore it later. If nothing is done to protect and reconnect koala habitat, population declines will continue unabated and extinction seems inevitable.  p
