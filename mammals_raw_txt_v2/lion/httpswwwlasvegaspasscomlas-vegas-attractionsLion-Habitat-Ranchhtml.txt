The home of the original MGM lions, the Lion Ranch is owned by cat enthusiast Keith Evans who brought his lions to the hotel for 15 years. Now, they all live in one place, in their very own 8.5 acre ranch where they can romp, play and groom each other in their pack of 40.  p 
 p Visitors can see the beautiful animals roaming free with their cubs and learn everything you need to know about lions through fascinating exhibitions and if you time it right, you can even see a feeding or join in some play time!  p
