 p The Kevin Richardson Wildlife Sanctuaryâ€™s mission is to provide a self-sustaining African carnivore sanctuary for the purposes of wild species preservation. Through education, outreach and funding, our mission is to bring awareness to the rapid decline of large carnivores in Africa due to habitat loss, human-predator conflict, the illegal bush meat trade, unscrupulous hunting, disease, and illegal trade.  p 
 p There are thought to be as few as 15000-20000 lions left in the wild in Africa. Today the biggest threats lions face are habitat loss (largely due to human encroachment), human â€“ lion conflict (retaliatory and pre-emptive killings), illegal bush meat trade (consequences which include indiscriminateÂ snaring and prey depletion),Â unscrupulous trophy hunting, lion poaching (for the lion bone trade in the far east) and to a lesser extent disease.  p 
 p Lion populations face a combination of these threats in the affected lion range states where numbers are declining.  p 
 p Every time I look into Georgeâ€™s deep brown eyes Iâ€™m reminded of his horrible start to life and the consequences he suffers from, to this day, as a result. Metabolic bone disease, juvenile cataracts and several fractures to name a few. He is one of the lucky ones.  br 
Recently the DEA (Department of Environmental Affairs) released its progress report in implementing the recommendations of the colloquium on captive lion breeding. What is astonishing is that out of the 227 lion breeding facilities inspected, 88 were found to be non compliant and many had expired permits or no permits. Unfortunately this is not the worst of it, as it appears as though there really is no appetite for change at this stage. Iâ€™ll be filming a video for  a href="https:  www.facebook.com hashtag lionwhispererTV" #lionwhispererTV  a  expressing my thoughts on this report.  p 
 p Animals are no different from us, in that occasionally they have dental issues.  However, itâ€™s not quite a simple as getting them to open wide!  Last year, with the help of some fantastic veterinarians, we made a world record for the most root canals done in one day.  We hope you enjoy seeing these incredibly intimate behind-the-scenes moments.  Donâ€™t forget to brush! ðŸ˜‰  br
