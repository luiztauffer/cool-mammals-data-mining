 p align="center" The vision for In-Sync Exotics started in 1998 and was officially established in 2000. As a non-profit organization we are dedicated to the rescue of neglected, abused and unwanted exotic felines. It is our dream that one day there will be no need for rescue facilities, but until that day happens, we will continue to educate the public on the unique attributes and characteristics of our residents; the realities of irresponsible and or illegal exotic wild animal ownership and captive breeding; and the need for stronger and enforceable legislation against those who abuse exotic wild animals.By visiting schools, churches, organizations, etc., through our Community Outreach Program we hope to educate as many people as possible on the work we do, and the amazing animals in our care. As part of our goal of educating the public, we offer scheduled group tours 7 days a week.  p
