One estrus out of every 5 results in a litter and lions mate approximately 2.2 times per hour for the 4 day estrus period.  The first male member of a pride that reaches a female in heat has the mating priority over her.  Fighting between pride members over females does not normally occur.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#3aa508bb4c4bc4c650288ccd9a8a9e6d" class="citation" Estes, 1993  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Male lions are conspicuously large and showy because they have the opportunity to control the reproduction of many females when they rule over a pride. Males form coalitions with each other to increase their chances of pride takeover.  The fierce competition among males and the social structure of a pride have led to infanticide by both males and females. Successful males that takeover a pride have about 2 years before another younger, stronger coalition will replace them. Pride takeover battles are often violent leading to severe injury or death of the losing lions.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" It is to the successful male’s reproductive advantage to kill the suckling cubs of the defeated males. A nursing lioness that loses her cubs will come back into estrous within 2 to 3 weeks. The normal time between births is 2 years, which is the typical time for a male to rule a pride.  Therfore, by killing all unweaned cubs at the time of pride takeover, males can ensure that they have some opportunity to father offspring of females who would otherwise not be available to them during their tenure as pride leaders. Females vigorously defend their cubs during a takeover and are sometimes killed also.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#3aa508bb4c4bc4c650288ccd9a8a9e6d" class="citation" Estes, 1993  a ;  a href="#a7bc6ca333b02e1cb772ed7293dab1e5" class="citation" Packer and Pusey, 2001  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" The resident males of a pride are immigrants that have forcefully gained control of the pride from the previous male members.  In order to successfully take over a pride, males form coalitions, usually consisting of brothers.  Adolescent males leave their natal pride when their fathers (or the new male leaders of the pride) begin to view them as competition at about 2.5 years.  These males lead nomadic lives for two to three years, then form a coalition and seek a pride to take over.  Male coalitions of 2 tend to rule a pride for no more than two and a half years, long enough for one set of cubs to be reared.  Coalitions of three and four tend to rule a pride for longer than 3 years.  Coalitions of more than four are rare, most likely because large coalitions are difficult to keep together.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#3aa508bb4c4bc4c650288ccd9a8a9e6d" class="citation" Estes, 1993  a ;  a href="#1d5a7f6d78677c1f7dc094cf39127d06" class="citation" Packer, et al., 1990  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Prides are comprised of related females.  Females are lifelong residents in their mother’s territory.  Female pridemates do not compete or fight with each other and do not display the kinds of dominance behavior that are observed in many matriarchal social systems. Related females in the same pride tend to have synchronous reproduction, and they cross-suckle their cubs.  This cooperative behavior discourages dominance behavior. In contrast, males are very aggressive with other pride members, especially when feeding. The lack of dominance among females may have made it easier for communal cub-raising, since females are unable to influence the reproduction of other female pride members. Alternatively, the mutualistic benefits of communal cub-raising may have reduced the tendency to form pride hierarchies.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Lions have the great ability to critically injure or kill other lions when engaged in a fight. Fighting with a pridemate of similar age and sex not only threatens the survival of the individual but also risks injuring a valuable team-member that could later help to defend the pride against intruders.  It would seem, therefore, that intrapride aggression would be selected against.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#3aa508bb4c4bc4c650288ccd9a8a9e6d" class="citation" Estes, 1993  a ;  a href="#a7bc6ca333b02e1cb772ed7293dab1e5" class="citation" Packer and Pusey, 2001  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" The lions of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania have been studied continuously since 1966. Research has shown that lions form groups for many reasons besides greater hunting efficiency. Because lions live at higher population densities than other large cats, there is a great need for pride members to collectively defend their territory against takeovers by other lions. Also, lionesses reproduce synchronously and form highly stable groups that defend their cubs against infanticide. Finally, smaller prides tend to be more gregarious than larger prides in order to defend their territory as a group.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#1d5a7f6d78677c1f7dc094cf39127d06" class="citation" Packer, et al., 1990  a )  span   p

In an area with bountiful prey, lions spend approximately twenty hours per day sleeping.  They become most active in the late afternoon, mainly socializing with the pride.  Hunting typically takes place at night and into the hours of the early morning.  p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Lions have the cognitive ability to recognize individuals and to interact with other lions to benefit their own survival. They use visual cues in this communication. For example, the mane is thought to signal to other lions the sex of a male from a distance and to indicate individual fitness.  (The rate of mane development is mostly controlled by testosterone.)  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Resident male lions regularly mark their territory by spraying vegetation with urine and by scuff-marking. Females spray occasionally. This behavior starts at the age of 2 years. This type of marking uses both chemical and visual communication signals.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Male lions start to roar at 1 year of age and females start shortly after this. The male’s roar is both louder and deeper than the female's. Lions can roar at any time, but they typically stand or crouch while roaring. Roaring serves to advertise territories, to communicate with other pride members, and to demonstrate aggressions toward enemy lions. Lions also roar in chorus; this may be a form of social bonding. This is accoustic communication.  p

FIV does not seem to adversely affect lions but it will kill domestic cats.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#a7bc6ca333b02e1cb772ed7293dab1e5" class="citation" Packer and Pusey, 2001  a ;  a href="#d78bd2caa5b94648d76bf244889c648a" class="citation" Urban and West, 2002  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Asiatic lions,  span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species" P. l. persica  span , are confined to one population in the Gir Forest reserve of India, consisting of less than 200 mature individuals. This subspecies is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list and is on Appendix I of CITES.  Another population of Asiatic lions is desperately needed in order to safeguard the survival of this subspecies. The Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Madhya Pradesh had been identified as a potential reintroduction site in India.  Threats to the Gir Forest population include the close proximity of humans and their cattle and habitat degradation.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#33da4d738dd8fd70be05ddf13c9725ea" class="citation" "Asiatic Lion Information Center", 2001  a ;  a href="#39c562667246b30d65a67a00fe5710ea" class="citation" Cat Specialist Group 2001, 2003  a ;  a href="#34b139a6d8b6469db9de7baa1704ba66" class="citation" O'Brien, et al., 1987  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Some very small lion populations require genetic management in order to survive and maintain genetic diversity. Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park (HUP) in Natal, for example, has a population of 120 lions produced from only three lions that were introduced into the park in the 1960s. In 2001, researchers tried artificial insemination techniques to rejuvenate the genetic pool of these South African lions. This process is very difficult and energy intensive. Inbred populations could also potentially be rejuvenated by introducing adult females and whole prides into an area (minimizing conflict between existing lions and introduced lions).  span class="citations"  ( a href="#b278495420b00f8a0f0385c5fd36e34c" class="citation" Trivedi, 2004  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Fortunately, individual lions can be dependably identified in an unobtrusive manner. Lion whisker spots are similar to our finger prints.  Every individual lion has a unique whisker spot pattern. More specifically, the number and relative position of whisker spots on the top row are used to identify individuals.  p
