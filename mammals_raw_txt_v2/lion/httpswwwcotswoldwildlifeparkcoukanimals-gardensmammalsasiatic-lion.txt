Dry scrubland and open deciduous forest habitats. This species used to be found across the whole of Northern Africa, south west Asia and northern Greece.

 p  strong WHAT THEY EAT  strong  br 
These are carnivorous animals and will feed on almost any animal from rodents through to large ungulates. However, larger animals such as deer, antelope, wild boar, and buffalo form the largest part of their diet. An adult female lion needs about 5kg of meat per day, a male about 7kg but they can gorge up to twice this amount when food is scarce.  p
