 p Lions are larger and stronger than hyenas, but what advantage do hyenas have over lions?  p 
 p Hyenas outnumber lions and use their larger populations to compete with lions for food.  p 
 p What characteristics cause hyenas and lions to come into conflict?  p 
 p Hyenas and lions cover the same ground, hunt the same prey, and scavenge the same remains of animals. Consequently they steal food from each other, chase each other, and even kill each other's young.  p 
 p Should humans conservationists intervene to reduce the conflict between lions and hyenas? Why or why not?  p 
 p Possible responses: Yes, because we need to protect animals. No, because it's a natural phenomenon.  p
