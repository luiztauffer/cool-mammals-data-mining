Orana’s unique Lion Encounter takes visitors through the African Lion Habitat on board a specially modified vehicle for extremely close views of the “King of Beasts” feeding. The Lion Encounter provides a wonderful opportunity to appreciate the size and power of these awesome predators.  p 
 p style="text-align: justify;" Hop on board our vehicle with our keepers, who feed the cats from within the safety of the vehicle, and become immersed in the lion habitat. Our cats often climb onto the roof of the vehicle so you can literally get eye-to-eye with these magnificent animals as well as having the opportunity to interact with our specialised keepers who care for the animals.  p 
 p style="text-align: justify;" This is a must do experience whilst in Christchurch!  p
