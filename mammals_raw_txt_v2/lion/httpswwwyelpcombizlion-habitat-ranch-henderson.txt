 p itemprop="description" An absolutely breathtaking experience.

The Lion Habitat Ranch features different subspecies of the African Lion. While the Ranch is unable to breed the animals, the numerous big cats have come here for conservation efforts &amp; it seems they are thriving. The majority of the animals are retired from the MGM. According to one of the volunteers, the average life expectancy of a lion in captivity ranges from 15-20 years. However, they have female lions who are exceeding that life span. Which, in my opinion, is a true testament of the care and love these animals receive. You can tell just from walking through that each trainer and volunteer have a genuine passion for these animals. They were all incredible to talk to and were happy to answer everyone's questions. Also, hearing these cats roar while you're walking through the park is fascinating! It was so cool to hear &amp; see them communicating.

Ozzie the giraffe also lives here. He is absolutely beautiful &amp; a very talented artist. Ozzie paints the day away and all of his artwork is available in the gift shop. I bought an adorable keychain for $5! You can also feed him for a pretty cool up-close experience.

There are also a number of bird species throughout the Ranch.

Lion Habitat Ranch is run completely through volunteers &amp; donations. Which is very humbling, considering these guys require a lot of maintenance. I would love to volunteer one day - super cool!

Bring your families and friends! The Lion Habitat Ranch is a super fun experience filled with amazing animals &amp; very knowledgeable volunteers. Plus, visiting helps save the animals!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" 35 fully grown lions with some great photo op spots, Stanley the painting giraffe standing tall at close to 16 feet, talking parrots, emus, tortoise, ostriches...makes a fun day. Keepers are informative and puts on regular feedings and shows (like lion playing with pumpkins). Worth the price of admission.

      p 
 p itemprop="description" This was an amazing experience! All of the lions are well taken cared of &amp; seem happy! All of the care takers were all knowledgeable &amp; answered all of our questions &amp; interacted with the lions for us visitors to see. The lions are so beautiful &amp; Ozzie (the giraffe) is a plus! 

Look out for some special times; Ozzie paints &amp; one of the caretakers gets in the cage with two female lions (we missed this)  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" I went for my anniversary with my boyfriend and we had a WONDERFUL time! It was such an amazing experience to be able to be that close to those beautiful magnificent animals. Lions are my FAVORITE big cat so I was in heaven! The animals looked great and are well taken care of and all the staff are extremely knowledgeable and have a great amount of respect for the animals. It was so much fun And I definitely will be back!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" Spent about 2 hours here last weekend with my 7 year old and boyfriend.  We all enjoyed it. The volunteers were great &amp; the animals seem well cared for. The giraffe Ozzy paints! There's a small gift shop that sells his paintings, some shirts, jewelry, post cards, snacks etc. There's a bathroom in the gift shop. If you pay $10 extra you can feed and pet the giraffe! If you pay $20 extra you can go for a ride on the lion! Totally worth it. They also have parrots or some kind of bird that's like a parrot, macaw? Ostriches, maybe an emu too. There were little birds you can feed (kind of like chickens but not really) so bring a quarter for the machine. I liked this place and will definitely go back one day. Btw, just kidding about the lion rides!!!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" This is the best big cat sanctuary i've ever been to. It was amazing to me how close you could get to the Lions. The lions looked is though they were very comfortable in their habitat. I was amazed at how well everything was kept for the animals. If you go to Vegas this is a must see you will be completely amazed.  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" What an amazing experience! My husband and I did the VIP tour and had a chance to feed Jesse the lion. All worth it!!!! They took us from lion to lion to introduce us, tell us about their personality, and watch as they were fed and interacted with our guide.  They all had a story. Such beautiful animals! At some point we were in the middle of the ranch and they started roaring. WOW!!! So powerful! We met Ozzy the giraffe and immediately fell in love. So sweet, curious, playful, and loving! We met the owner and you could tell how much she loved the animals as she watched mesmerized and spoke of Ozzy and the lions. It's an amazing place. Would highly recommend it!!!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" Must see in Vegas, 15 min or so from the strip and literally soooo fun! I heard about this gem from a cab driver and had to visit! The staff is sooooooo caring, fun,  kind, educated, compassionate and loving towards the animals.  I was impressed by how clean the cages were and how happy the animals were. The lions that were at the MGM are now retired here and living a good life.  Animals are very well kept and cared for.  It is worth watching the feedings and watching Ozzie paint. I would love to volunteer here and will definitely be back to visit with friends!

      p 
 p itemprop="description" Cool place! The animals are beautiful; and there's more variety than you'd expect. Be sure to ask the awesome staff questions and they'll tell you loads of fun facts.  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" My husband love  Experience but lucky didn't love him we saw the look of fear my husband when lucky roared at him but it was awesome to see the lions so up in close and the people in charge knew so much about the lions that you couldn't walk away from them because all you wanted to do was have a conversation with them and talk more about the lions there a way of living and that lion habitat memories were made we will be you going back  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" This place was a hit for my lion-loving husband. 

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical, but I fell kind of hard just watching these majestic beauties do big cat sh*t.

Oh, and Ozzie, the giraffe, was a huge hit with our kids. So were the beautiful, yet, seemingly overheated birds. They have misters (the watering kind, not gigilos, but when in Vegas...), but still - it's only about 105 Â°F at around noon in June.

Why this place doesn't receive more major donations from all the rich and famous - I'll never understand. 

Cute gift shop. 

Our 3-year-old toddler was free.

TIPS
- make reservations online &amp; sign your waiver ahead of time

2018 Challenge #107  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" I came to visit my friends that live in Las Vegas &amp; Henderson, NV. My one friend has resided in Henderson for two years now and she never knew about this hidden local gem. They are located behind the M casino just off the 15 and Rose. It's a little hard to see the sign to turn into the lot but if you see the Burger King sign and look towards the opposite direction you will see where you turn on Bermuda.  

The staff are very friendly.  It was a super hot the day when we went (around 112 degrees) so we were grateful for the cooling off station where we purchased snow-cones and sat in front of a big fan. This area is also a gift shop where you can buy some t-shirts and unique items.  

Before entering you need to sign a waiver (duh! LOL!) and pay (duh, again). I paid $25.00 but if you are a Henderson resident you can pay $20.00.  

There are plenty of lions, ostrich and a beautiful giraffe that paints.  You can feed the giraffe for $10.00.  Oh yes, I did mention that the giraffe 'paints' and he sells his handy-work (or should I say 'lip-work') in the gift shop.  While the giraffe can paint it is the lions roar that is most impressive. At one point in our visit one lion let out a big roar and then all the other lions started roaring...that was super-cool! 

Next time you are in the Vegas area, save a bundle, slow down your roll and visit this fabulous family friendly place.  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" The place is on St.Rose and Bermuda, i think it has around 15 to 20 lions, a giraffe, few ostriches and parrots, cockatoos, fowls. They do close pretty early in the day at 2pm so if you would like check everything out be sure to give it about around 40 to about little over an hour. They have few small events throughout the day like Giraffe painting and lion feedings, that will take about 10 mins of your tour in there. Otherwise it takes about maybe 20-30 minutes to walk through the small park. 
Ours was a little longer because OZZIE the giraffe was feeling like nap time instead of painting time, and no yummy cookies could of got Ozzie to stand up and show us his master painting skills.  At the end he was gracious enough to give us a quick show.

Admission is $20 regular adult, they have local students senior discounts or if it is your birthday month you can go in for free anytime of the month, also free admission for small children too. The admission does directly go to pay for the food for the lions and giraffe so you would be helping out the habitat with your little contribution. Bring a bottle of water with you I'm the summer as it gets very hot walking around in 115 degree weather. A lot of the lions are hiding in their little temperature controlled shade boxes.. so you wont get to see them directly unless the trainers are out feeding them. 

It is a fun place for kids, or if you have a hour to kill around the area during the weekends and feeling like seeing some big cats, it could be a quick fun adventure!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" This is an incredible place for anyone to come visit. Couples, families, seniors, teens. The lions are beautiful. Ozzie the giraffe is adorable. The workers are knowledgeable and very nice! The money you pay to visit all goes right back into the habitat because this is a non profit. The owner of the place is rad. I don't know his name. He feeds Tara and peaches (the two oldest lions there aka the golden girls) Definitely one of the coolest places to go to in Nevada. 100% recommended!!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" This was such a fun experience! The staff interacts with the lions and you can tell they really enjoy what they do. Ozzy the giraffe is amazing with his painting tricks and you get to be up close and personal. This is a great place to get the family together or even come on a date.  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" My kids loved the painting giraffe and the lions. We had a great experience. So much fun!!!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" Absolutely had a blast !! Take your kids they will be more than happy to see these beautiful animals up close!! Also spend the 10 dollars and feed the giraffe yourself! My kids and I will
Keep coming back!  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" My husband and I purchased the Groupon for a Behind the Scenes Tour for 2. This was an awesome experience. There is a lot of construction around the location so plan to get there a bit early. Once you are inside, it was amazing to see all the lions up close and personal. The lions are huge and very pampered. We got a chance to learn about their individual care and temperaments. The caretakers and volunteers are devoted to the animals.It is small, so if you go as general admission, I think I would be disappointed. I am recommending the behind the scenes tour to my friends and family.  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" Sometimes your forget in this crazy city that there are places like this where you can come see beautiful majestic animals and have a good time. 

The Lion Habitat is very much worth the visit and they have great trainers here to take you through and explain to you about the animals.  

This place is a must see.  p 
 p 
      p 
 p itemprop="description" This place is a great visit for kids and adults. I saw over 30 lions on the property along the feeding in the mid afternoon. The staff is very knowledgeable and the animals are very well taken care of. It is hot as he** out there so bring lots of water and fluids. They do have mist machines on the property which helps.
In addition to the Lions they have a giraffe which you can actually feed. I went on Father's Day the admission was 10.00 normally it's 25 adults and 10 for kids.We had a great time as the Lions are very close and my son loved it..  p

At one point in our visit one lion let out a big roar and then all the other lions started roaring...that was super-cool!  br  br Next time you are in the Vegas area, save a bundle, slow down your roll and visit this fabulous family friendly place.  p

 p lang="en" The place is on St.Rose and Bermuda, i think it has around 15 to 20 lions, a giraffe, few ostriches and parrots, cockatoos, fowls. They do close pretty early in the day at 2pm so if you would like check everything out be sure to give it about around 40 to about little over an hour. They have few small events throughout the day like Giraffe painting and lion feedings, that will take about 10 mins of your tour in there. Otherwise it takes about maybe 20-30 minutes to walk through the small park.  br Ours was a little longer because OZZIE the giraffe was feeling like nap time instead of painting time, and no yummy cookies could of got Ozzie to stand up and show us his master painting skills. Â At the end he was gracious enough to give us a quick show. br  br Admission is $20 regular adult, they have local students senior discounts or if it is your birthday month you can go in for free anytime of the month, also free admission for small children too. The admission does directly go to pay for the food for the lions and giraffe so you would be helping out the habitat with your little contribution. Bring a bottle of water with you I'm the summer as it gets very hot walking around in 115 degree weather. A lot of the lions are hiding in their little temperature controlled shade boxes.. so you wont get to see them directly unless the trainers are out feeding them.  br  br It is a fun place for kids, or if you have a hour to kill around the area during the weekends and feeling like seeing some big cats, it could be a quick fun adventure!  p

 p lang="en" This is an incredible place for anyone to come visit. Couples, families, seniors, teens. The lions are beautiful. Ozzie the giraffe is adorable. The workers are knowledgeable and very nice! The money you pay to visit all goes right back into the habitat because this is a non profit. The owner of the place is rad. I don't know his name. He feeds Tara and peaches (the two oldest lions there aka the golden girls) Definitely one of the coolest places to go to in Nevada. 100% recommended!!  p

 p lang="en" This was such a fun experience! The staff interacts with the lions and you can tell they really enjoy what they do. Ozzy the giraffe is amazing with his painting tricks and you get to be up close and personal. This is a great place to get the family together or even come on a date.  p

 p lang="en" My husband and I purchased the Groupon for a Behind the Scenes Tour for 2. This was an awesome experience. There is a lot of construction around the location so plan to get there a bit early. Once you are inside, it was amazing to see all the lions up close and personal. The lions are huge and very pampered. We got a chance to learn about their individual care and temperaments. The caretakers and volunteers are devoted to the animals.It is small, so if you go as general admission, I think I would be disappointed. I am recommending the behind the scenes tour to my friends and family.  p

 p lang="en" Sometimes your forget in this crazy city that there are places like this where you can come see beautiful majestic animals and have a good time.  br  br The Lion Habitat is very much worth the visit and they have great trainers here to take you through and explain to you about the animals. Â  br  br This place is a must see.  p

 p lang="en" This place is a great visit for kids and adults. I saw over 30 lions on the property along the feeding in the mid afternoon. The staff is very knowledgeable and the animals are very well taken care of. It is hot as he** out there so bring lots of water and fluids. They do have mist machines on the property which helps. br In addition to the Lions they have a giraffe which you can actually feed. I went on Father's Day the admission was 10.00 normally it's 25 adults and 10 for kids.We had a great time as the Lions are very close and my son loved it..  p

            I have worked for over 43 years in close contact with all big cats and the social nature of lions has been my greatest pleasure. br  br It is and has been a privilege to be accepted by all of our lions over the last 24 years at this location. We are constantly making improvements to our lions' environment, well being and living quarters.
