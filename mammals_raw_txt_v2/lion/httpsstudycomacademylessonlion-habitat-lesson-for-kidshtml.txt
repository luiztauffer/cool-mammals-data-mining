 p Diane has taught all subjects at the elementary level, was the principal of a K-8 private school and has a master's degree in Measurement and Evaluation.   p 
 p Imagine this: You are walking through an open, grassy plain when you hear it. That loud, echoing roar can only mean one thing. Lions are nearby and might be hungry. You decide to sneak quietly away while keeping an eye out for one of these big cats that might want to make a snack out of you!   p 
 p When you picture a lion, you probably imagine it prowling through a dry, grassy plain dotted with a few trees here and there. But just like people live in different kinds of houses, lions live in different kinds of  b habitats  b , or places where they are naturally found in the wild. These habitats all provide excellent hiding places so lions can hunt without being detected. If you're looking for lions, you can find them hanging out in the following kinds of habitats in Africa and Asia:   p 
 p This habitat blends together with open woodlands. Depending on how much rain it gets and how high up it is, the grass may be short or almost 10 feet tall. It has a long, cool, dry season and a shorter, hot, moist season.   p 
 p The trees in this habitat are deciduous, or the kind that lose their leaves, because there isn't enough rain for evergreen trees to grow. This kind of habitat makes up about a fourth of the continent of Africa.   p 
 p This habitat has very hot, dry summers so a lot of the plants are inactive or die back during this season. But it's wet and cooler during the winter, which is when most of the tough, thorny brush and bushes grow.   p

 p Lions are meat eaters, also called  b carnivores  b . The biggest females can weigh around 400 pounds and the biggest males can weigh about 570 pounds. In order to get enough food, lions hunt the animals that live in their habitats like you go grocery shopping at the store. Depending on where they live, some of their favorite meals are zebras, antelopes, giraffes, warthogs, crocodiles, rhinos, birds, and rodents.   p 
 p Although you need to drink water to survive, it's not as important in a lion's habitat. Lions will drink water if they find some, but they can also get the water they need from the animals they eat and from the plants that grow in their habitat.   p 
 p Scientists are worried about lions because there aren't as many as there used to be. Besides hunting and sickness, lion habitats are shrinking because people are moving on to the land where lions usually live, forcing them out.   p 
 p The only natural lion habitats that are left are on  b reserves  b , which are areas of guarded and protected land set aside for the animals who live there. People are working to protect the lions and their habitat so that they can survive and their numbers can increase.   p 
 p Lions live in different  b habitats  b  in Asia and Africa, including savannas, open woodlands, and scrublands. They are  b carnivores  b  and hunt animals like zebras, rhinos, and antelopes that live in their habitat. The only natural lion habitats that are left are on protected  b reserves  b , though people are working to protect lions and the land where they live so they can survive.  p
