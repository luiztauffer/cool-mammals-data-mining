 p The  b lion  b  ( i Panthera leo  i ) is a  a href=" wiki Species" title="Species" species  a  in the family  a href=" wiki Felidae" title="Felidae" Felidae  a ; it is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. The lion is  a href=" wiki Sexually_dimorphic" class="mw-redirect" title="Sexually dimorphic" sexually dimorphic  a ; males are larger than females with a typical weight range of 150 to 250 kg (330 to 550 lb) for males and 120 to 182 kg (265 to 400 lb) for females. Male lions have a prominent mane, which is the most recognisable feature of the species. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of female lions typically hunt together, preying mostly on large  a href=" wiki Ungulate" title="Ungulate" ungulates  a . The species is an  a href=" wiki Apex_predator" title="Apex predator" apex  a  and  a href=" wiki Keystone_predator" class="mw-redirect" title="Keystone predator" keystone predator  a , although they scavenge when opportunities occur. Some lions have been known to hunt humans, although the species typically does not. 
  p 
 p Typically, the lion inhabits  a href=" wiki Grassland" title="Grassland" grasslands  a  and  a href=" wiki Savanna" title="Savanna" savannas  a  but is absent in dense  a href=" wiki Forest" title="Forest" forests  a . It is usually more  a href=" wiki Diurnality" title="Diurnality" diurnal  a  than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active  a href=" wiki Nocturnality" title="Nocturnality" at night  a  and  a href=" wiki Crepuscular" class="mw-redirect" title="Crepuscular" at twilight  a . In the  a href=" wiki Pleistocene" title="Pleistocene" Pleistocene  a , the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in  a href=" wiki Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa" Sub-Saharan Africa  a  and one critically endangered population in western India. It has been listed as  a href=" wiki Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species" Vulnerable  a  on the  a href=" wiki IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List" IUCN Red List  a  since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,  a href=" wiki Habitat_loss" class="mw-redirect" title="Habitat loss" habitat loss  a  and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
  p 
 p One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in  a href=" wiki Menagerie" title="Menagerie" menageries  a  since the time of the  a href=" wiki Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire" Roman Empire  a  and have been a key species sought for exhibition in  a href=" wiki Zoological_garden" class="mw-redirect" title="Zoological garden" zoological gardens  a  across the world since the late 18th century.  a href=" wiki Cultural_depictions_of_lions" title="Cultural depictions of lions" Cultural depictions of lions  a  were prominent in the  a href=" wiki Upper_Paleolithic" title="Upper Paleolithic" Upper Paleolithic  a  period; carvings and paintings from the  a href=" wiki Lascaux" title="Lascaux" Lascaux  a  and  a href=" wiki Chauvet_Cave" title="Chauvet Cave" Chauvet Caves  a  in France have been dated to 17,000 years ago, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures that coincided with the lion's former and current ranges.

Some females, however, take a role raising cubs that may be left alone for extended periods. Members of the pride tend to regularly play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride; hunters are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken.

 p Lion taming refers to the practice of taming lions for entertainment, either as part of an established  a href=" wiki Circus" title="Circus" circus  a  or as an individual act such as  a href=" wiki Siegfried_%26_Roy" title="Siegfried &amp; Roy" Siegfried &amp; Roy  a . The term is also often used for the taming and display of other big cats such as tigers, leopards and  a href=" wiki Cougar" title="Cougar" cougars  a . The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American  a href=" wiki Isaac_A._Van_Amburgh" title="Isaac A. Van Amburgh" Isaac Van Amburgh  a , who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers. sup id="cite_ref-baratay187_245-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-baratay187-245" [245]  a   sup  Van Amburgh performed before  a href=" wiki Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria" Queen Victoria  a  in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a  a href=" wiki Pantomime" title="Pantomime" pantomime  a  titled  i Les Lions de Mysore  i  ("the lions of Mysore"), an idea that Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed  a href=" wiki Equestrianism" title="Equestrianism" equestrianism  a  acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema.

The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans. sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-248" [248]  a   sup

 p In their analysis of man-eating – including the Tsavo incident – Kerbis Peterhans and Gnoske acknowledge that sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but that the behaviour is "not unusual, nor necessarily 'aberrant span style="padding-right:.15em;" '  span " where the opportunity exists; if inducements such as access to livestock or human corpses are present, lions will regularly prey upon human beings.

 p The lion's proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period – a number far exceeding the Tsavo attacks. The incidents occurred near  a href=" wiki Selous_Game_Reserve" title="Selous Game Reserve" Selous National Park  a  in  a href=" wiki Rufiji_River" title="Rufiji River" Rufiji District  a  and in  a href=" wiki Lindi_Region" title="Lindi Region" Lindi Province  a  near the Mozambican border.

 p The "All-Africa" record of man-eating generally is considered to be a collection of incidents between the early 1930s and the late 1940s in modern-day Tanzania inflicted by a pride known as the "Njombe lions".
