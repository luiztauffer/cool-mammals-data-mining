 p Mountain lions need room to roam, and the rugged mountains northwest of Los Angeles provide this protected species the space it needs to hunt and breed. The problem? Their population is suffering as these creatures are killed crossing the roads intersecting their habitat. The solution? Build bridges over these roads enabling mountain lions to proliferate in safety. In this lesson, you'll use ArcGIS Pro to create the geoprocessing models identifying the best locations for these overpasses.  p
