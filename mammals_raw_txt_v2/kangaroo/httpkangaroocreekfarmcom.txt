BOOKINGS  a   p 
 p We have been keeping kangaroos and wallabies for more than 20 years on our farm in Lake Country near Kelowna BC. We do not promote them as house-pets but rather as alternative hobby farm pets to very specific types of situations.We currently have Red Kangaroos (the largest type of kangaroo), Common Wallaroos and Bennett Wallabies (which are mid sized), and Dama Wallabies (one of the smallest wallaby species). Also on site we have emu, peacocks, fancy chickens, goats, parrots, a baby albino wallaby, baby kangaroos and potbellied pigs. We also have capybara, the worldâ€™s largest rodent, which can weigh more than 150 lbs!  p 
 p Visitors can enjoy wandering amongst the kangaroos. Our staff are very knowledgeable about kangaroos and wallabies and are on hand to answer any questions you might have about various species, habitat, breeding, diet, housing and general physiology. Your visit can be as educational an experience as you choose to make it.  p 
 p  strong This is a very special, free activity that we try to provide to our guests to the best of our ability.  strong   p 
 p In high season we get a lot of visitors. There are very limited numbers of joeys. We try our best to accommodate as many people as possible. We regret the long wait time and the short holding time but there is essentially nothing we can do about it other than offering the following advice:  p 
 p The perfect visit in regard to short waits and extended snuggling happens during the shoulder seasons. If you can avoid the weekends and the holidays thatâ€™s even more optimal. Visitors that come during these periods can often sit and hold multiple joeys for as long as they please.  p 
 p Thanks, and see you at the farm!
				  p 
 p Kangaroo Creek Farm prides itself on being as non-commercial as possible. We like to keep things real and un-Disneyfied. You wonâ€™t be asked to exit through the gift shop because there isnâ€™t one. Thereâ€™s a small unobtrusive pop ice cream stand being run by our teenage son but thatâ€™s about it for commercial enterprise once youâ€™ve paid your admission at the gate. You wonâ€™t be asked to pay extra for treats to feed the animals (our guides hand them out). We donâ€™t charge extra for holding a joey, a sugar glider, or the parrots. However, the last 3 activities I mentioned are not a guaranteed activity. They are an extra something that we try and provide to the best of our ability but there are only so many joeys, so many sugar gliders, and so many parrots. Sometimes the farm is very busy and we simply cannot accommodate everyone. If you choose to participate in these extras that we try and provide then it is possible that you might have to line up, wait, and be patient. A good way to avoid having to wait or put up with large crowds is to come in the off season, avoid the weekends and the holidays, and peak times of day.  p 
 p  strong Commercial groups and clubs such as schools, Home-School groups, Boys and Girls Clubs, YWYMCA, daycares and institutions must email to book a day to visit.  strong  Visit our  a class="content_link" href="http:  kangaroocreekfarm.com group-visits " Group Visits  a  page for more information. This is important!  p 
 p We are happy to invite Lake Country retirement homes, schools and daycares to visit us for free as part of our community service but we have to draw the line somewhere. To all the groups, clubs, schools, daycares and organizations that have contributed, Thank You!
