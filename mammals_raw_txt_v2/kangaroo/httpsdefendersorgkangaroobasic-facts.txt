 p Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion.  p 
 p Because of its long feet, a kangaroo cannot walk normally.  p 
 p To move at slow speeds, a kangaroo will use its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs. It then raises its hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called "crawl-walking."  p 
 p Usually, female kangaroos give birth to one joey at a time. Newborns weigh as little as 0.03 ounces at birth -  strong as small as a lima bean  strong ! After birth, the joey crawls into its mother's pouch, where it will nurse and continue to grow and develop. Red kangaroo joeys do not leave the pouch for good until they are more than eight months old. Gray kangaroo joeys wait until they are almost a year old.  p
