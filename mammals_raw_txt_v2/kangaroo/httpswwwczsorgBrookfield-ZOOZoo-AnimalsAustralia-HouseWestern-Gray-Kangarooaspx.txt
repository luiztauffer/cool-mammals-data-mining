		Western gray kangaroos are sexually dimorphic (with two distinct gender forms); males are about twice the size of females. Gray kangaroos are light gray-brown to chocolate in color. They are bipedal (move with two legs), with powerful hind legs and tail. They have four toes on their hind feet. The two inside toes are jointed and form a grooming tool. The extra-long middle toe has a sharp nail that is used as a weapon. Their large ears can turn in all directions. Females have pouches. Their muzzle is covered in fine hair. The margins of their nostrils are bare black skin.  p 
 p 
		They are common. Some species have increased in numbers and range due to resources available from cattle ranching. They are hunted for meat and skins. In some areas, they are overhunted. The kangaroos are also shot as pests and culled due to high numbers in some areas. Culling is controversial, but this sustainable-use concept may prove to be advantageous.  p
