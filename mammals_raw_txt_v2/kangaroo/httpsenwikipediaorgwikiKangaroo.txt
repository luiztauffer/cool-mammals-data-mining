 p Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialised teeth that are rare amongst mammals. Its  a href=" wiki Incisor" title="Incisor" incisors  a  are able to crop grass close to the ground and its  a href=" wiki Molars" class="mw-redirect" title="Molars" molars  a  chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The  a href=" wiki Silica" class="mw-redirect" title="Silica" silica  a  in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-38" [38]  a   sup  This process is known as  a href=" wiki Polyphyodont" title="Polyphyodont" polyphyodonty  a  and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in  a href=" wiki Elephants" class="mw-redirect" title="Elephants" elephants  a  and  a href=" wiki Manatees" class="mw-redirect" title="Manatees" manatees  a .

Kangaroos and wallabies are adept  a href=" wiki Aquatic_locomotion" title="Aquatic locomotion" swimmers  a , and often flee into waterways if presented with the option. If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to  a href=" wiki Drowning" title="Drowning" drown  a  it. sup id="cite_ref-camuseum_31-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-camuseum-31" [31]  a   sup  Another defensive  a href=" wiki Tactic_(method)" title="Tactic (method)" tactic  a  described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog with the forepaws and  a href=" wiki Disembowel" class="mw-redirect" title="Disembowel" disembowelling  a  it with the hind legs.
  p 
 p Kangaroos have developed a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. As with all  a href=" wiki Marsupial" title="Marsupial" marsupials  a , the young are born at a very early stage of developmentâ€”after a  a href=" wiki Gestation" title="Gestation" gestation  a  of 31â€“36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the  a href=" wiki Pouch_(marsupial)" title="Pouch (marsupial)" pouch  a  and attach to a  a href=" wiki Teat" title="Teat" teat  a . In comparison, a human  a href=" wiki Embryo" title="Embryo" embryo  a  at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and  a href=" wiki Premature_birth" class="mw-redirect" title="Premature birth" premature babies  a  born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive. When the joey is born, it is about the size of a  a href=" wiki Phaseolus_lunatus" class="mw-redirect" title="Phaseolus lunatus" lima bean  a . The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180â€“320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.
  p 
 p The female kangaroo is usually pregnant in permanence, except on the day she gives birth; however, she has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous  a href=" wiki Joey_(marsupial)" class="mw-redirect" title="Joey (marsupial)" joey  a  is able to leave the pouch. This is known as  a href=" wiki Embryonic_diapause" title="Embryonic diapause" diapause  a , and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch.
  p 
 p Unusually, during a dry period, males will not produce sperm, and females will conceive only if enough rain has fallen to produce a large quantity of green vegetation. sup id="cite_ref-animal_41-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-animal-41" [41]  a   sup 
  p 
 p  Kangaroos and wallabies have large, elastic tendons in their hind legs. They store elastic strain energy in the  a href=" wiki Tendon" title="Tendon" tendons  a  of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort. sup id="cite_ref-tendons_&amp;_hopping_42-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-tendons_&amp;_hopping-42" [42]  a   sup   This is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeletons through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos.
  p 
 p There is also a link between the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is expelled from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and  a href=" wiki Wallaby" title="Wallaby" wallabies  a  have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predatorsâ€”the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countriesâ€”but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.
  p 
 p New research has revealed that a kangaroo's tail acts as a third leg rather than just a balancing strut. Kangaroos have a unique three-stage walk where they plant their front legs and tail first, then push off their tail, followed lastly by the back legs. The propulsive force of the tail is equal to that of both the front and hind legs combined and performs as much work as what a human leg walking can at the same speed.

 p Kangaroo reproduction is similar to that of  a href=" wiki Opossum" title="Opossum" opossums  a . The egg (still contained in the shell membrane, a few micrometres thick, and with only a small quantity of yolk within it) descends from the  a href=" wiki Ovary" title="Ovary" ovary  a  into the  a href=" wiki Uterus" title="Uterus" uterus  a . There it is fertilised and quickly develops into a  a href=" wiki Neonate" class="mw-redirect" title="Neonate" neonate  a . Even in the largest kangaroo (the  a href=" wiki Red_kangaroo" title="Red kangaroo" red kangaroo  a ), the neonate emerges after only 33 days. Usually, only one young is born at a time. It is blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long; its hindlegs are mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its way through the thick fur on its mother's  a href=" wiki Abdomen" title="Abdomen" abdomen  a  into the pouch, which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the four teats and starts to feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After about 190 days, the baby ( a href=" wiki Joey_(marsupial)" class="mw-redirect" title="Joey (marsupial)" joey  a ) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after about 235 days, it leaves the pouch for the last time. sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-50" [50]  a   sup  The  a href=" wiki Life_expectancy" title="Life expectancy" lifespan  a  of kangaroos averages at six years in the wild sup id="cite_ref-patricia_51-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-patricia-51" [51]  a   sup  to in excess of 20 years in captivity, varying by species. sup id="cite_ref-park_52-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-park-52" [52]  a   sup  Most individuals, however, do not reach maturity in the wild. sup id="cite_ref-nowak_53-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-nowak-53" [53]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-giganteus_54-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-giganteus-54" [54]  a   sup

 p Unlike many of the smaller macropods, kangaroos have fared well since  a href=" wiki History_of_Australia" title="History of Australia" European settlement  a . European settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for  a href=" wiki Domestic_sheep" class="mw-redirect" title="Domestic sheep" sheep  a  and cattle grazing, added stock watering points in arid areas, and have substantially reduced the number of  a href=" wiki Dingo" title="Dingo" dingoes  a .

 p There are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation; however, several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a  a href=" wiki Rabies" title="Rabies" rabies  a -like disease possibly affecting the marsupials. The only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in New South Wales, in 1936. A hunter was killed when he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray. Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger. In July 2011, a male red kangaroo attacked a 94-year-old woman in her own backyard as well as her son and two police officers responding to the situation. The kangaroo was capsicum sprayed (pepper sprayed) and later put down after the attack. sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-59" [59]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-60" [60]  a   sup 
  p 
 p A collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo. Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often leap in front of cars. Since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around 50Â km h (31Â mph) and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe. Small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage. The risk of harm or death to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the  a href=" wiki Windscreen" class="mw-redirect" title="Windscreen" windscreen  a  is the point of impact. As a result, "kangaroo crossing" signs are commonplace in Australia.
  p 
 p Vehicles that frequent isolated roads, where roadside assistance may be scarce, are often fitted with " a href=" wiki Bull_bar" class="mw-redirect" title="Bull bar" roo bars  a " to minimise damage caused by collision.  a href=" wiki Hood_(vehicle)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hood (vehicle)" Bonnet  a -mounted devices, designed to scare wildlife off the road with  a href=" wiki Ultrasound" title="Ultrasound" ultrasound  a  and other methods, have been devised and marketed.
  p 
 p If a female is the victim of a collision, animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey, in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for  a href=" wiki Wildlife_rehabilitation" title="Wildlife rehabilitation" rehabilitation  a . Likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a  a href=" wiki Veterinary_surgeon" class="mw-redirect" title="Veterinary surgeon" vet  a , the  a href=" wiki RSPCA_Australia" title="RSPCA Australia" RSPCA Australia  a  or the  a href=" wiki National_Parks_and_Wildlife_Service_(South_Australia)" title="National Parks and Wildlife Service (South Australia)" National Parks and Wildlife Service  a  can be consulted for instructions on proper care. In New South Wales, rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from  a href=" wiki NSW_Wildlife_Information_and_Rescue_Service" class="mw-redirect" title="NSW Wildlife Information and Rescue Service" WIRES  a .  Council road signs often list phone numbers for callers to report injured animals.
