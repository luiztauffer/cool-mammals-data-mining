 p Kangaroos are very versatile animals and they are able to live in a variety of different habitats out there in Australia and Tasmania. Other smaller macropods can also be found around Tasmania and New Guinea. They are also found on some islands on the outskirts of Australia. They have started to be found in places that they never explored before. The reason for this is that they are looking for food.  p 
 p Some of them thrive in the woodlands, others in the dry Savannah desert. Still yet, there are some that are living in the grassy plains areas. What is interesting is that these animals aren’t only found in Australia like so many people think. They are even found living along rocky edges and cliffs.  p 
 p What you will find is that particular species happen to be in particular regions. They have been well identified in those selective areas. For example the Red Kangaroo is mainly found out there around the open plains. They adapt very well to the dry climate found in many areas of Australia.  p 
 p Both the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroos prefer a climate that offers them more moisture. That is why they are going to be found in the woods and thick forest areas. However, due to their natural habitat continually being taken away it is now known that their habitat also overlaps in those very dry regions with the Red Kangaroos. They have more of an area that they cover in Australia than any other species of Kangaroo. This is why they are the one most people are familiar with.  p 
 p You may not know it but there are even some species of kangaroos that live just in trees. They don’t seem to do quite as well there as other types of animals though. Observing them you will quickly see they are very clumsy. Yet they are doing what they can to adapt to such an environment in order to survive. They are found along the Northern Queensland area and into the far regions of New Guinea.  p 
 p Experts believe that many smaller species and subspecies of Kangaroos out there live where you can’t see them. They burrow underground and only come out on occasion. Therefore it is reasonable to believe that just about anywhere out there in the wild around Australia you will have the opportunity to come into contact with different species of Kangaroos. This can be very exciting if you are in that area then make the most of it.  p 
 p All Kangaroos are very adaptable creatures so don’t be surprised if you see different species out of the element where they are reported to be. They have a desire to survive and a very instinctive nature for going about doing so. If they can’t get their basic needs met in a given location then they are going to continue moving on until they are able to do so.  p 
 p The serious issue about the habitat for Kangaroos happens to be the issue of it getting smaller and smaller. People continue to decide to use that same land for their own needs. This makes it very hard for these animals to be able to find enough food and shelter for their survival. Hopefully, efforts out there to preserve their remaining habitat areas will be a success.  p 
 p By educating people about what can be done to protect them more people are taking an interest. The problem is that many people don’t realize their own actions are creating problems for the habitat of Kangaroos as well as other animals. When they are able to see this information before they make such a choice they are going to be less likely to move forward with it.  p
