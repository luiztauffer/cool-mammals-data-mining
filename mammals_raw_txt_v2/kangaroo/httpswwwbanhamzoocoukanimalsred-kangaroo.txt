 p Red kangaroos are marsupials (pouched mammals) and are the largest of all the kangaroo species.  p 
 p Size: Head-body length - 85-160cm, Tail - up to 120cm br 
Weight: Up to 95kg  p 
 p Red kangaroos live in grassland, semi-desert and desert areas in Australia.  p 
 p Red kangaroos are herbivores eating mainly grass. Kangaroos have front teeth in both the upper and lower jaw, so they can crop grass more closely than sheep, which only have lower front teeth.  p 
 p A young red kangaroo (joey) is born after 33 days, measuring just 2 cm (3 4 inch). It spends the next 8 months in the mother's pouch and continues to suckle for a further 6 months after leaving the pouch.  p 
 p The red kangaroo is not considered endangered. The population is currently stable and widely distributed, and they are found in a number of protected areas.  p
