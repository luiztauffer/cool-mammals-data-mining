 span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana" class="style14" Our aim is 
to be the flagship of a ‘See Australia’ promotion based around wildlife tourism 
with the marvellous mob of marsupials - the kangaroos and their kind. Through 
partnerships with conservation agencies, tourism organisations, operators and 
gateway communities across the continent and offshore islands our vision is to 
place Australia at the forefront of nature-based tourism destinations for both 
our international visitors and our citizens. Australia will be  b the  b   b 
destination  b  for seekers of the natural world as we capitalise on our unique 
wildlife heritage. We seek to expand wildlife tourism with the kangaroos as our 
flagship fauna by revealing an array of opportunities and a diversity of 
experiences. We  encourage visitors to make it a mission to see all of 
Australia’s species of kangaroos so that their tourist dollar will have real and 
realisable benefits through the economic activity of wildlife tourism to nature 
conservation and the local communities and agencies who maintain habitat for 
flagship species such as the kangaroos. We unashamedly promote kangaroos as a 
wild living entity to be enjoyed and appreciated many times over for their 
fascinating behaviour and biology and not their meat and hide products.  span   p

  span   a href="http:  www.australia.com " class="style14" www.australia.com  a  span class="style14" . Each 
State and Territory has a tourism portal to assist you in planning your journey. 
Furthermore, each State and Territory has a Parks and Wildlife authority where 
you can gain more information on the national parks and nature reserves which 
are your destinations, and on the fauna and flora you can expect to see. We list 
the websites for the best-place-to-see destinations in the fact sheets for each 
species or recognised subspecies.

 p class="MsoNormal"  span class="style14"  span class="style14"  span lang="EN-AU" The best place to see each species or 
subspecies of kangaroos and their kind has been selected to maximise the 
likelihood of close viewing in the wild. However, with the exception of the 
Musky Rat-kangaroo, species are most active at night leaving cover and resting 
places around dusk and retiring back to these refuges around dawn. The best time 
to view most species is therefore towards dusk and into the early evening when 
they commence foraging. If you have the option, you should choose still evenings 
without rain as most species retreat to cover or are particularly flighty under 
inclement weather conditions, especially strong winds. Some species habitually 
use dense cover (e.g. long-footed potoroo) and will be very difficult to see. 
However, most emerge into clearings or open habitat adjacent to forest edges or 
sparser shelter, and stationing yourself at such sites is usually rewarding. 
Rock-wallabies often sun themselves in cooler weather and may remain visible 
amongst the rocks towards dusk and for a period after dawn. During dry and warm 
periods, water bodies are an attractant and drinking, like foraging, usually 
starts around dusk and continues into the early evening. Many species are 
inactive for a few hours around midnight as they digest a filled gut before 
foraging again.

 p class="style14" The best strategy to employ for your 
viewing experience is to get local knowledge from wildlife rangers. Back this up 
with your own observations of sign such as faecal pellets (usually black and 
hard and not massed like rabbits or goats), tail drags and foot prints in 
suitable substrates like sandy soils. Station yourself comfortably in a good 
viewing location against a background that masks or disrupts your shape, and 
wait patiently for your subjects to emerge. If you prefer to stalk, then an 
oblique rather than a direct approach to a subject is preferable. Macropods have 
excellent senses of smell and hearing but vision is optimised for the night 
rather than the day and so you can mask your presence by being downwind, quiet 
and against a non-contrasting background. At night you will need a form of 
illumination – strong torch (flashlight) or spotlight. Detection is best 
achieved by scanning at maximum illumination but observation should be by 
holding the subject at the edge of the light or at minimal intensity if your 
device has a dimmer or switchable intensity (e.g. LED devices). Red filtering of 
light only has an effect through reduced intensity and not colour and so it is 
not recommended. Natural behaviour will be maximised and disturbance minimised 
if you have access to a generation 2 or better Night Vision Device supplemented 
by infrared illumination (e.g. spotlight with infrared transmission filter or 
array of infrared LED). However, NVDs are very expensive and binoculars and dim 
supplementary lighting may suffice.  p

 p  span class="style14" This website is the electronic sibling of 'The Kangaroo Trail Map', a large 
format map (A1) of the best place to see the kangaroos and their kin. This paper map is available by postage - contact  a href="mailto:info@rootourism.com" info@rootourism.com  a  with your postal address. While a paper map is static and evolves only if a new edition is printed, this website is dynamic and participatory. 'The Kangaroo Trail Map' project
is a not-for-profit initiative developed to provide an  understanding of the marvellous diversity of Australia's iconic kangaroo 
fauna. The kangaroos and their kind provide key services to the function of our ecosystems (e.g. spread beneficial fungi in our forests, maintain diversity in our grasslands, turn over and fertilise soils) and our well-being (including our connectedness to the land). Without them we are much dimished, and so we hope to engender a respectful attitude to the 'mighty macropods' and your proactive support for their conservation. br

 p  span class="style2" This project is a private endeavour and is not sponsored by 
any Australian government tourism or wildlife agency. However, we do thank NT, SA, TAS, WA and QLD tourism for letters of 
encouragement and Tourism Australia for assistance with the launch of the 
Kangaroo Trail Map.  span class="style14" The project was conceived within the Wildlife Tourism sub-program of the now de-commissioned  a href="http:  www.crctourism.com.au" Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre  a . A further life was provided by conceptual support from  a href="http:  www.wildlifetourism.org.au" Wildlife Tourism Australia  a . Seed funding for the concept, map and website has been provided by the  a href="http:  www.ifaw.org ifaw_asia_pacific " International Fund for Animal Welfare  a , in a grant to the Sustainable Toursim CRC; and  a href="http:  www.voiceless.org.au" class="style14" Voiceless  a , the fund for animals, in a grant to the   span  span class="style14"    span   a href="http:  www.awpc.org.au " class="style14" Australian Wildlife Protection Council  a  span class="style14" . These organisations have been consistent in their support for and generous funding of wildlife tourism projects that lead to a non-consumptive and respectful treatment of animals. Even so their views are expressed on their websites and publications and not here. Likewise their funding has finished and is not ongoing. If you feel moved to make a financial contribution to the upkeep of the project then there is a PayPal button on the feedback page. We're happy if you get out there and (metaphorically) embrace your chosen kangaroo species!  span   span  br
