 p The 18" Mom and Joey Kangaroo by HANSA is an individually hand-crafted plush animal from Hansa’s heirloom quality Collection. Created by artists in a socially responsible environment, and using portraits of animals in their natural habitat, each HANSA animal has its own unique personality. All HANSA plush items, feature "coats" meticulously cut by hand, and never stamped out by machine. Each Hansa animal comes with soft paws, swishing tails, and especially soulful eyes. Their adorable faces are lovingly detailed to create the” true to life” look that is unmistakably HANSA. This adorable, realistic HANSA creation provides a lifetime of joy to collectors and animal lovers of all ages. HANSA is world renowned for providing the world’s largest range of finely crafted plush wildlife recreations. Originally created for exclusive European collectors, each plush animal is lovingly handcrafted from portraits of real animals in their natural habitat. HANSA’s goal is to help educate children and adults alike, about the preservation of these magnificent creatures, and to understand, respect and appreciate the importance of our co-existence with all animals. Each animal comes with a "Toys that Teach" tag describing, in detail, the animal's habitat, lifestyle, gestation period, care of their young and eating habits. Significant research goes into reproducing every animal species. As noted above, the fabric for the spotted and striped animals is custom designed and exclusively manufactured in small quantities to HANSA’s exacting specifications. Their "coats" are meticulously hand-cut and trimmed, never stamped out by machine. Hand sewn leather paws, swishing tails and especially soulful eyes and faces are lovingly detailed to give each piece their lifelike look. Each and every animal produced is hand finished by HANSA's artists to create each with their very own unique personality (just as in real life).
