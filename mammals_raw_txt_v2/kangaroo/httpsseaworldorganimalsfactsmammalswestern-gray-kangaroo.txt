 p Since the late 18th century, human settlement has drastically changed kangaroo numbers and distribution. Loss of many grassland areas from grazing domestic cattle and introduced species such as rabbits, mean negative effects on native Australian species such as kangaroos.  p 
 p Before European settlement, native Aboriginal peoples utilized the kangaroos for meat and hide.  p 
 p While many species have decreases in number due to human population and introduction of predators such as the red fox and domestic cats and dos, some species' populations have actually risen, causing kangaroos in some areas to be considered pests. Farmers concerned about damage to fences and crops often cull them under license in some areas.  p
