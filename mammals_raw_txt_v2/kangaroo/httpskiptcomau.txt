 p class="card-text" The site of the proposed export facility is on Kangaroo Island's sheltered North Coast. It has deep water for berthing large ships and relatively flat land suitable for stockpiling timber products. It is also a partially degraded site, having been a former land-based abalone farm, and does not provide habitat for any critically endangered species. Smith Bay is close to plantation resources compared to many other proposed sites.
