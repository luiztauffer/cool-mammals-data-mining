 p The  b kangaroo  b  is a mammal. It is a marsupial. This means it carries its baby in a pouch. Kangaroos and other marsupials such as the  a href=" wiki Koala" title="Koala" koala  a , the  a href=" wiki Tasmanian_devil" title="Tasmanian devil" Tasmanian devil  a , and the  a href=" w index.php?title=Opossum&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Opossum (page does not exist)" opossum  a  live in  a href=" wiki Australia" title="Australia" Australia  a  and the New World.
  p 
 p Kangaroos are the largest living marsupials from the family  i Macropodidae  i . There are four species: the red kangaroo, the eastern grey kangaroo, the western grey kangaroo, and the antilopine kangaroo.
  p 
 p Fossil remains of about 30 different kangaroo species have been discovered in Australia. One is a giant type that probably stood 10 feet (3 meters) tall.
  p 
 p Kangaroos have powerful hind legs, a long, strong tail, and small front legs. They are the largest of all marsupials. They stand over 6 feet (2 meters) tall. 
  p 
 p Thanks to their large feet, kangaroos can leap some 30 feet in a single bound, and travel more than 30 mph (48 kmh).  Kangaroos use their strong tails for balance while jumping.
  p 
 p If threatened, kangaroos pound the ground with their strong feet as a warning. Fighting kangaroos kick opponents, and sometimes bite.
  p 
 p Kangaroos live in the forests, woodlands, grassy plains, and savannas of  a href=" wiki Australia" title="Australia" Australia  a , surrounding islands, and  a href=" wiki Tasmania" title="Tasmania" Tasmania  a . They number in the millions.
  p 
 p Kangaroos eat grasses. They are plant-eating grazers. This means they stand in one place to eat all the plants they can reach. They can live for a long time without water.
  p 
 p Kangaroos live and travel in groups called mobs, troops, or courts. These groups are dominated by the largest male. Male kangaroos are called boomers, bucks or jacks; females are does, flyers, or jills, and the babies and young ones are called joeys.
  p 
 p Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of traveling. Because of its long feet, a kangaroo cannot walk normally. To move at slow speeds, a kangaroo will use its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs. It then raises its hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called "crawl-walking."
  p 
 p Female kangaroos usually give birth to one joey at a time. Newborns weigh about 0.03 ounces at birth - as small as a grape. They are about an inch long. 
  p 
 p After birth, the joey crawls into its mother's pouch. Here, it will nurse, and continue to grow and develop. Joeys leave the pouch between 8 and 12 months.
  p 
 p Besides humans and wild dogs called  a href=" w index.php?title=Dingo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dingo (page does not exist)" dingoes  a , kangaroos face few natural predators. Heat, drought, and hunger due to loss of habitat are the biggest dangers kangaroos face.
