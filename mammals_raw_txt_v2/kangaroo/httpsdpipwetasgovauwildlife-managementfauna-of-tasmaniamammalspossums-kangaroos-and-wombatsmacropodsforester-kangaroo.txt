 p Foresters often feed during the day, but mostly in the early morning and evening. Grasses and forbs comprise the diet. Forester kangaroos are social animals that are usually seen in family groups of three or four, but may occur in loosely associated mobs of more than ten. Like all macropods, the Forester kangaroo moves by hopping. At moderate speeds, such a form of locomotion is more energy efficient than quadrapedal running.  p 
 p  br Kangaroos can damage crops and pastures where local populations are high. Due to their large size, they can also damage fences. As a result they can come into conflict with landholders.
