 p High in the treetops of tropical Far North Queensland lives a remarkable creature, the tree kangaroo. Once common throughout the Atherton Tablelands and Daintree Rainforest, the tree kangaroo is now in danger due to large-scale habitat loss for agriculture and urban development, resulting in fragmented landscapes and the need for tree kangaroos to travel across the ground where they fall prey to dogs and cars. In addition, scientists believe that this species is under threat from predicted climatic changes, which will affect important tree kangaroo habitat.  p
