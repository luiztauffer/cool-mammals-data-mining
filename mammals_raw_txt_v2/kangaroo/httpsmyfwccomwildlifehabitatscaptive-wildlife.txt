 p Florida requires permits for wildlife possession, exhibition and sale.  p 
 p Commercial and private facilities must have permits for many types of native and nonnative animals - including potentially dangerous animals, such as Florida black bears and Florida panthers. These facilities include zoos, circuses, alligator farms, pet shops, tropical fish farms and individuals who own a class I, II or III animal ( a data-udi="umb:  document a24973cfd6234a3396ff9c5f04516a17" href=" license captive-wildlife " title="Captive Wildlife" see wildlife categories  a ).  p

 p The FWC enforces the statutes and regulations governing Florida's wildlife industry.  p 
 p FWC officers routinely conduct inspections to ensure humane treatment and sanitary conditions are in place for the animals, and cage and security requirements are adhered to for public safety. The FWC's regulations, relative to cage sizes, safety and humane treatment, are among the most stringent in the nation.  p
