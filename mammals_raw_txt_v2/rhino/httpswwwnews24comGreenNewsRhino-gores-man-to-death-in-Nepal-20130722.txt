 p Kathmandu - A rhinoceros gored a man to death as he fished in a river in southern Nepal in what experts said on Monday was a rare event.  p 
 p The 38-year-old was killed on Saturday by the animal in Chitwan National Park, Nepal's biggest conservation area, located in the southern plains, police said.  p 
 p Although attacks on humans are common as deforestation forces wildlife to stray into villages, rhinos rarely kill people, an expert said.  p 
 p "Rhinos are not aggressive animals so it's rare for them to kill humans," the park's chief warden, Kamal Jung Kunwar, told AFP.  p
