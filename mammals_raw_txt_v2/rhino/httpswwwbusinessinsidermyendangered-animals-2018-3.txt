 p   Last March,  a href="http:  www.dailymail.co.uk news article-5521563 Last-male-northern-white-rhino-dies-Kenya-keepers.html"   the world’s last male northern white rhino  a , Sudan, died at 45  years of age.  p 
 p   Sudan – who is named for his country of birth and lived under the  protection of armed guards at the  a href="https:  www.olpejetaconservancy.org wildlife rhinos northern-white-rhinos "   Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya  a , away from poachers – suffered  from a degenerative muscle and bone condition and was euthanized.    p 
 p   Fortunately, scientists were able to gather genetic material that  could one day be used to create more northern white rhinos  through IVF. Sudan also left behind a daughter and granddaughter,  so there’s a flicker of hope for the wildlife preservation  community.   p 
 p   Even so, there are numerous other animal species and subspecies  that are in danger of perishing for good. The Amur leopard and  Sumatran elephant are just two of 19 species  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species directory?sort=extinction_status&amp;amp;direction=desc"   categorized as “critically endangered” by the World Wildlife  Fund  a , while the white-rumped vulture, Philippine crocodile,  and Chinese pangolin have been given the equivalent  classification on the  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org " IUCN  Red List  a .  p 
 p   Keep scrolling to see 23 animals that are on the verge of  extinction.  p 
 p   This subspecies – which is  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species amur-leopard" also known  as the Far East leopard, the Manchurian leopard, or the Korean  leopard  a , despite being nearly extinct outside of the Amur  River basin in eastern Russia – can run upwards of 37 miles an  hour and jump as high as 19 feet in the air.   p 
 p    a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org stories amur-leopard-world-s-rarest-cat-doubles-in-population"   According to a 2015 census  a , there are only around 60 Amur  leopards left, all living at Russia’s Land of the Leopard  National Park.  p 
 p   Found only on the island of Borneo, Asia’s largest  island, Bornean orangutans have broader faces and shorter beards  than  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species sumatran-orangutan" their  arboreal Sumatran cousins  a .  p 
 p   There are  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species bornean-orangutan" three  subspecies of Borean orangutans  a : Northwest, Northeast, and  Central. The largest is the Central subspecies, of which  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species bornean-orangutan" there  are an estimated 35,000  a . The most threatened is the Northeast  subspecies: due to its habitat being decimated by logging and  hunting, there are only about 1,500 extant Northeast Borean apes.  p 
 p   Scientists predict that  a href="https:  blogs.scientificamerican.com extinction-countdown bornean-orangutan-critically-endangered "   the Bornean orangutan population will fall another 22% by  2025  a , bringing the total number down to 47,000.  p 
 p 
  p 
 p    a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species mountain-gorilla" At just  under 900  a , the current population size is low, but  conservationists are working to ensure that mountain gorillas  don’t fall prey to human threats.  p 
 p   According to the African Wildlife Foundation,  a href="http:  www.awf.org wildlife-conservation mountain-gorilla" the  greatest threats to mountain gorillas  a  – an eastern gorilla  subspecies – are political instability (mainly conflicts in  the Democratic Republic of Congo), human encroachment, and forest  degradation.  p 
 p   The remaining mountain gorilla population is spread out  over three countries and four national parks, such as Bwindi  Impenetrable National Park in Uganda, and Virunga National Park  in DRC.  p 
 p 
  p 
 p   Native to a mountainous region of Vietnam and Laos, “saola” means  “spindle horns” in Vietnamese.   p 
 p   Like antelope and bison, the saola belongs to  a href="http:  www.edgeofexistence.org species saola " the ruminant  artiodactyl family Bovidae  a . According to the World Wildlife  Fund, this enigmatic creature is super rare – scientists  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species saola" have only  documented wild saola on four occasions  a .   a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species saola"   a   p 
 p    a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species hawksbill-turtle" This sea  turtle  a , which has a hawk-like pointed beak, can be found in  tropical oceans around the world.  p 
 p    a href="https:  www.nationalgeographic.com animals reptiles h hawksbill-sea-turtle "   Humans pose a large threat  a  to hawskbills, whose population   a href="http:  www.seeturtles.org hawksbill-turtles " has  decreased by 80% over the last century  a . Despite their   a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species hawksbill-turtle" protected  status  a  under the Convention on International Trade in  Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, people still  eat their eggs and kill them for their flesh and colorful shells.  They’re also susceptible to being ensnared in fishing nets.   p 
 p   Back in the 1950s, there were  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species south-china-tiger" an  estimated 4,000 South China tigers  a . Although China banned  poachers from hunting these wildcats in 1979, the population  dipped to between 30 and 80 by the end of the 20th century.  p 
 p    a href="https:  www.bloomberg.com features 2016-stuart-bray-south-china-tigers "   About 100 tigers remain in captivity  a , Bloomberg reported in  2016.  p

 p   The  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species yangtze-finless-porpoise" Yangtze  porpoise  a , native to China’s longest river, is a close  relative of the  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org press-releases chinese-river-dolphin-baiji-feared-extinct-hope-remains-for-finless-porpoise"   most-likely-extinct Baji dolphin  a .  p 
 p   It’s estimated that  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species yangtze-finless-porpoise" between  1,000 and 1,800  a  of these intelligent, mischievous-looking  porpoises remain.  p 
 p   The Sumatran elephant thrives in lush forests and  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species sumatran-elephant" can  weigh up to five tons  a .  p 
 p   In 2012, the species was categorized  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species sumatran-elephant" as  “critically endangered” by the WWF  a . Due to habitat  decimation, half of its population was lost over the course of  one generation, and the WWF estimates that between 2,400  and 2,800 remain.  p 
 p   Several tree species would disappear if Sumatran orangutans die  out, as the animals play an important role in seed dispersal.  p 
 p   Fires and deforestation, however, are continuing to decrease this  animal’s habitat. Orangutans are also victims of illegal  trafficking.  p 
 p 
  p 
 p   The black rhino population has increased somewhat since then, and  there are 5,000-5,400 black rhinos in the world today.   p 
 p   However, poaching and trafficking of rhino horns still prevents  the species from recovering to early 20th-century levels.   a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species black-rhino" The  WWF says  a  rhinos are some of the oldest mammals in the world,  and efforts to protect them benefit other species too, including  elephants.  p 
 p    a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species western-lowland-gorilla" According  to the WWF  a , the number of western lowland gorillas has  decreased by at least 60% in the past 20 or 25 years.   p 
 p   Poaching and disease are the primary threats – the Ebola virus is  still prevalent, and some scientists say it has killed about 33%  of the wild gorilla population, mainly targeting the western  lowland gorilla.  p 
 p   Ebola also makes poaching dangerous for people, as the virus  could spread to humans who handle gorilla meat.  p 
 p   Poaching leads to nearly 80% of Sumatran tiger deaths, and there  is no proof that poaching has gone down much in the past two  decades,  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species sumatran-tiger" according  to the WWF  a .   p 
 p   Deforestation also triggeres a deadly cycle – as habitats are  destroyed by human activity, tigers look for food elsewhere and  are more likely to run into humans as they move away. They may  attack livestock or harm people, and villagers in turn kill more  tigers in retaliation.  p 
 p   The range of eastern lowland gorillas has decreased from 8,100  square miles to 4,600 square miles in the past 50 years,  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species eastern-lowland-gorilla" according  to the WWF  a .  p 
 p   Humans have destroyed a large chunk of this gorilla’s habitat to  create space for livestock and farmland. Protected areas, such as  Kahuzi-Biega National Park, cover a very small fraction of the  gorilla’s range.  p 
 p   Conservation efforts have been tough to execute due to military  activity in the region, and illegal mining is also harming the  species by attracting more people who hunt the gorillas.  p 
 p   The Javan rhino used to exist in larger parts of Asia, but it now  roams in only one location. The population is so small that the  lack of genetic diversity could make long-term survival very  difficult.   p 
 p   Javan rhinos all reside in a national park that is vulnerable to  tsunami and rising sea levels.  p 
 p   These gorillas live in an area that has seen increased  human activity in the past several years, from forest clearing  for timber use or agriculture.   p 
 p   Although hunting and killing cross river gorillas is  illegal in Nigeria and Cameroon, some people are not deterred,  particularly because wildlife laws are not strictly enforced.    p 
 p   This rhino used to roam parts of Bhutan and eastern India, and  scientists believe it was found in Vietnam and China as well.  Now, the Sumatran rhino only exists in Borneo and Sumatra.  p 
 p   Poaching has increased in the region due to an increase in demand  for rhino horns. In addition, deforestation, road construction,  and the presence of invasive species have all contributed to a  dwindling habitat for Sumatran rhinos.  p 
 p   As forests get converted to farmland, tigers come into increased  contact with livestock.  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species malayan-tiger" According  to the WWF  a , angry villagers or authorities often kill tigers  that come near agricultural spaces.  p 
 p   Malayan tigers are also threatened by poachers.  p 
 p 
  p 
 p   The orangutan is Asia’s only great ape, and a series of  agricultural plantations are steadily reducing their habitat.  p 
 p   Orangutans are slow and large, which has made them easy targets  for humans. People kill these animals either for food or in  retaliation when orangutans are spotted in agricultural areas.   p 
 p   The vaquita,  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species vaquita" the world’s  rarest marine animal  a , was first discovered in 1958.  a href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species vaquita" As few as 30  a   of these  a href="http:  www.ucmp.berkeley.edu mammal cetacea cetacean.html" cetaceans  a   (an order of animals that include whales, dolphins, and  porpoises) remain in the wild, according to the WWF. This  represents a decline of  a href="http:  www.marinemammalcenter.org science Working-with-Endangered-Species vaquita.html"   more than 92% since 1997  a .  p 
 p   Similar to the Philippine crocodile, they also fall prey to  entanglement, though, confined to the Gulf of California,   a href="https:  defenders.org vaquita basic-facts" climate  change might also have a negative impact on their ability to  persist  a  as global warming could impact habitat conditions and  the food chain.  p 
 p    a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 5672 0" Fewer than  200 adult Philippine crocodiles  a  are believed to exist in the  wild. The crocs are the victims of habitat loss and entanglement  in fishing equipment.  p 
 p   Possibly already extinct in southern China and Malaysia, the IUCN  states that  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 22695194 0" the white-rumped  vulture has suffered “catastrophic decline.”  a   p 
 p   Mother Nature Network reports a 99.9% decline since the ’80s –   a href="https:  www.mnn.com earth-matters animals stories 16-worlds-most-endangered-vulture-species"   the swiftest of any bird species in recorded history  a  – and  attributes it to a toxic veterinary drug that the vultures ingest  when they consume cattle carcasses.  p 
 p   The Chinese pangolin – native not just to China but to other  regions in Asia such as the Himalayan foothills of Nepal and  northern parts of India – is  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 12764 0" listed as  “critically endangered” on the IUCN Red List  a .  p 
 p   The scaly anteater, hunted for its meat and scales, is  a href="http:  www.cnn.com interactive 2014 04 opinion sutter-change-the-list-pangolin-trafficking "   the most trafficked mammal in the world  a  according to CNN.  An estimated  a href="http:  www.telegraph.co.uk science 2016 03 15 pangolins-13-facts-about-the-worlds-most-hunted-animal " 100,000  are captured every year  a .  p 
 p   According to the International Reptile Conservation Foundation,   a href="http:  www.ircf.org portfolio-view arboreal-alligator-lizard " the  alligator lizard is “severely endangered”  a  due to habitat  destruction and degradation and to illegal collection for the  international pet trade.  p 
 p   Reptiles magazine reports that they’re found in just a few select  locations, mainly the forests of Guatemala and Mexico, and that  they produce only one litter of offspring each year.   p 
 p   “ a href="http:  www.reptilesmagazine.com Lizard-Species Abronia-Arboreal-Alligator-Lizards " There  are some species [of the lizard] that may already be  extinct  a ,” reports the magazine.   p
