 p  strong Woodland Park Zoo is partnering with the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) to save the greater one-horned rhino in the wild.  strong   p 
 p All five living rhino species (black, white, greater one-horned, Sumatran and Javan) are in peril from poaching, forest loss and habitat conversion and human settlements encroaching on their habitats in India, Africa and Indonesia. Woodland Park Zoo is working with IRF, the government of Assam, and other key organizations to increase the population of the Greater one-horned rhino from a low of 200 throughout India and Nepal at the beginning of the 20th century to 3,000 in seven of Assam, India’s protected areas by the year 2020.  p 
 p The Turtle Survival Alliance’s India program is managed by Indian biologists who work with local communities to conserve imperiled turtle species. Converting former poachers into protectors, the program seeks to end the devastating illegal trade that has devastated turtle populations.  p 
 p    p 
 p Over 85% of the world’s Greater one-horned rhino population lives in Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India. This puts the population at risk from catastrophes like floods or disease outbreaks. By funding the translocation of rhinos to new protected parks, we are helping to decrease the possibility of human-rhino conflict, and increase the opportunity for population growth.  p
