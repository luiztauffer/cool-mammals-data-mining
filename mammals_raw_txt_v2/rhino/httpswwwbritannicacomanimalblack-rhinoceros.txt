 p  strong  span id="ref1022809"   span Black rhinoceros  strong ,  ( em Diceros bicornis  em ),  the third largest  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal rhinoceros-mammal" class="md-crosslink" rhinoceros  a  and one of two African  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science species-taxon" class="md-crosslink autoxref" species  a  of rhinoceros. The black rhinoceros typically weighs between 700 and 1,300 kg (1,500 and 2,900 pounds); males are the same size as females. It stands 1.5 metres (5 feet) high at the shoulder and is 3.5 metres (11.5 feet) long. The black rhinoceros occupies a variety of habitats, including open  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Plains" class="md-crosslink" plains  a , sparse  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science thorn-forest" class="md-crosslink autoxref" thorn scrub  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science savanna" class="md-crosslink" savannas  a , thickets, and dry forests, as well as mountain forests and moorlands at high altitudes. It is a selective browser, and grass plays a minor role in its diet. Where succulent plants, such as euphorbias, are abundant in dry habitats, it can survive without flowing water. Where water is available, drinking is regular and frequent; black rhinoceroses also dig for water in dry riverbeds. They are normally ill-tempered and unpredictable and may charge any unfamiliar sound or smell. Four subspecies are recognized, including one from  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Namibia" class="md-crosslink" Namibia  a  that lives in near-desert conditions.  p 
 p The black rhinoceros was originally widespread from the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Cape-of-Good-Hope" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Cape of Good Hope  a  to southwestern  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Angola" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Angola  a  and throughout  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place eastern-Africa" class="md-crosslink autoxref" eastern Africa  a  as far as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Somalia" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Somalia  a , parts of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Ethiopia" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Ethiopia  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Sudan" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Sudan  a . Its range also extended westward through the northern savanna zone to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Lake-Chad" class="md-crosslink" Lake Chad  a , northern  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Cameroon" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Cameroon  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Burkina-Faso" class="md-crosslink" northern Nigeria, Burkina Faso  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Cote-dIvoire" class="md-crosslink" Côte d’Ivoire  a , and possibly Guinea. Black rhinoceroses were abundant about 1900; some estimates put their numbers at more than one million individuals. Rampant  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic poaching-law" class="md-crosslink autoxref" poaching  a  reduced the total population to some 2,400 by 1995, but since then conservation efforts have brought the numbers up to approximately 4,800. Black rhinoceroses now occupy a much smaller area, within which they are found in scattered pockets, many of them in parks and reserves. The species still occurs in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place South-Africa" class="md-crosslink autoxref" South Africa  a , Namibia, Angola,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Zimbabwe" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Zimbabwe  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Mozambique" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Mozambique  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Malawi" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Malawi  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Zambia" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Zambia  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Tanzania" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Tanzania  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Kenya" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Kenya  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Botswana" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Botswana  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Eswatini" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Swaziland  a . Populations kept in well-guarded small sanctuaries and game ranches have expanded rapidly. The challenge now is to protect free-ranging black rhinoceroses in much larger reserves, such as the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Selous-Game-Reserve" class="md-crosslink" Selous Game Reserve  a  in Tanzania, a park the size of Switzerland. South Africa and Namibia have more black rhinoceroses than any other countries, but the future of the animals outside parks and reserves is rather bleak.  p
