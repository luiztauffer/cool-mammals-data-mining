Join the San Antonio Zoo as we raise funds and awareness for rhinos during the American Association of Zoo Keepers’ (AAZK) annual Bowling for Rhinos event.  p 
 p Bowling for Rhinos (BFR) provides zoo keepers of the world an avenue to raise funds and awareness for rhino and habitat conservation.  p 
 p AAZK’s BFR fundraiser began on a small scale and is now the signature conservation effort of AAZK. BFR events across North America raise over $450,000 annually.  p 
 p AAZK realized that the zoo keepers of the world were extremely conservation oriented and wanted to help save rhinos and their habitats, yet did not have the financial resources themselves to make any significant impact. That’s when the idea came to start a national bowl-a-thon called Bowling For Rhinos.  p 
 p In 1990, AAZK began by supporting the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (formerly Ngare Sergoi Rhino Sanctuary) in Kenya and has since expanded the program.  p 
 p The beauty of the idea is that these fundraisers are organized by volunteers, who donate their time and organizational skills to help raise money to send directly to the places in need. Since all the people involved are volunteers, 100% of all donations are sent directly to these in situ rhino conservation areas!  p 
 p Black Rhinos In Kenya, Africa, BFR supports the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy where our donations help protect both black and white rhinos and most of the other species native to East Africa.  p

 p In Indonesia BFR supports the remaining Javan Rhinos at Ujung Kulon National Park and the Sumatran Rhinos in Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks through the International Rhino Foundation.  p 
 p BFR also supports Action for Cheetahs in Kenya. Cheetahs share much of the same habitat as rhinos and by working to conserve cheetahs we are also saving rhinos and the countless other species that call that habitat home.  p
