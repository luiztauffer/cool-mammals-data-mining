 p The Rhinoceros hornbill is a large, cavity-nesting bird with black plumage, a white abdomen, and a long white tail crossed by a wide black band. Named for the upturned casque or “horn” that sits atop their giant colorful beaks, the males and females look alike except for their eye color (M-red, F-white).  p 
 p  strong What They Eat  strong   p 
 p Hornbills’ diets include mostly fruits, and occasionally insects, small animals, and birds. They eat by picking up their food with their long beak, throwing their head back, and swallowing it.  p 
 p  strong Where They Live  strong   p 
 p Rhinoceros hornbills need large trees to nest and feed. You’ll find them living in the thick, lowland hill forests of Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand.  p 
 p  strong What They Do  strong   p 
 p After the female lays 1-2 eggs, the pair uses mud and fruit to seal the female inside the tree cavity. The male passes food to her through a tiny hole while the female sits on the eggs. Thirty days after the chicks hatch, the female breaks out of the cavity and reseals the entrance. The chicks remain in the nest until they are about 80 days old.  p 
 p  strong How They’re Doing  strong   p 
 p he rhinoceros hornbills are currently decreasing in number, but are not yet endangered. The continued loss of habitat could threaten wild populations in the future.  p

 p The rhinoceros hornbill likes to return to the same area to nest each year, even if the area has been disturbed by human activity. Currently, its status in the wild is considered  strong near threatened due to habitat loss  strong  from logging, and from poaching.  p
