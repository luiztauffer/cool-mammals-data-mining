The precarious state of the surviving species (all but one are  span id="ref221305"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science endangered-species" class="md-crosslink" endangered  a ) is in direct contrast to the early history of this group as one of the most successful lineages of hoofed mammals. Today the total population of all the rhinoceros species combined is probably less than 30,000. Rhinoceroses today are restricted to eastern and southern Africa and to subtropical and tropical Asia.  p 
 p Rhinoceroses are characterized by the possession of one or two  span id="ref1035445"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science horn-zoology" class="md-crosslink" horns  a  on the upper surface of the snout; these horns are not true horns but are composed of  span id="ref1255409"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science keratin" class="md-crosslink" keratin  a , a fibrous  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science protein" class="md-crosslink" protein  a  found in hair. Modern rhinoceroses are large animals, ranging from 2.5 metres (8 feet) long and 1.5 metres (5 feet) high at the shoulder in the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal Sumatran-rhinoceros" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Sumatran rhinoceros  a  to about 4 metres (13 feet) long and nearly 2 metres (7 feet) high in the white rhinoceros. Adults of larger species weigh 3–5 tons. Rhinoceroses are noted for their thick skin, which forms platelike folds, especially at the shoulders and thighs. All rhinos are gray or brown in colour, including the white rhinoceros, which tends to be paler than the others. Aside from the Sumatran rhinoceros, they are nearly or completely hairless, except for the tail tip and ear fringes, but some  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science fossil" class="md-crosslink" fossil  a  species were covered with dense fur. The feet of the modern species have three short toes, tipped with broad, blunt nails.  p 
 p Most rhinoceroses are solitary. Individuals usually avoid each other, but the white rhinoceros lives in groups of up to 10 animals. In solitary species the home territory is crisscrossed with well-worn trails and often marked at the borders with urine and piles of dung.  p 
 p Rhinoceroses have poor eyesight but  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary acute" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="acute" acute  a  senses of hearing and smell. Most prefer to avoid humans, but males, and females with calves, may charge with little provocation. The  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal black-rhinoceros" class="md-crosslink autoxref" black rhinoceros  a  ( em Diceros bicornis  em ) is normally ill-tempered and unpredictable and may charge any unfamiliar sound or smell. Despite their bulk, rhinoceroses are remarkably agile; the black rhinoceros can attain a speed of about 45 km (30 miles) per hour, even in thick brush, and can turn around rapidly after missing a charge. Like elephants, rhinoceroses communicate using  span id="ref1035447"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science infrasonics" class="md-crosslink" infrasonic  a  frequencies that are below the  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary threshold" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="threshold" threshold  a  of human hearing. The use of infrasonic frequencies is likely an  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary adaptation" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="adaptation" adaptation  a  for rhinoceroses to keep in touch with each other where they inhabit dense vegetation and probably for females to advertise to males when females are receptive to breeding.  p 
 p Rhinoceroses are by far the largest of the  span id="ref1255410"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal perissodactyl" class="md-crosslink" perissodactyls  a , an order of hoofed mammals that also includes the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal horse" class="md-crosslink" horses  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal zebra" class="md-crosslink" zebras  a . One of the features of very large body size in mammals is a low  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science birth-rate" class="md-crosslink autoxref" reproductive rate  a . In rhinoceroses, females do not conceive until about six years of age;  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science gestation" class="md-crosslink" gestation  a  is long (16 months in most species), and they give birth to only one calf at a time. The period of birth between calves can range from 2 to 4.5 years. Thus, the loss of a number of breeding-age females to poachers can greatly slow the recovery of rhinoceros populations. However, an  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal Indian-rhinoceros" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Indian rhinoceros  a  female will conceive again quickly if she loses her calf. In this species  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal tiger" class="md-crosslink" tigers  a  kill about 10–20 percent of calves. Tigers rarely kill calves older than 1 year, so those Indian rhinoceroses that survive past that point are invulnerable to nonhuman predators.  p 
 p The three Asian species fight with their razor-sharp lower outer incisor  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science tooth-anatomy" class="md-crosslink" teeth  a , not with their horns. In Indian rhinoceroses such teeth, or  span id="ref1035446"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science tusk-anatomy" class="md-crosslink" tusks  a , can reach 13 cm (5 inches) in length among dominant males and inflict lethal wounds on other males competing for access to breeding females. The African species, in contrast, lack these long tusklike incisors and instead fight with their horns.  p 
 p The rhinoceros’s horn is also the cause of its  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary demise" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="demise" demise  a . Powdered rhinoceros horn has been a highly sought commodity in  span id="ref1035448"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science traditional-Chinese-medicine" class="md-crosslink" traditional Chinese medicine  a —not as an  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic aphrodisiac" class="md-crosslink autoxref" aphrodisiac  a , as is often widely reported, but as an antifever agent. Substitute agents have been found, particularly  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal pig-mammal-group" class="md-crosslink" pig  a  bone and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal water-buffalo" class="md-crosslink" water buffalo  a  horn, but rhinoceros horn commands tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram in Asian markets. Today  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic poaching-law" class="md-crosslink autoxref" poaching  a  remains a serious problem throughout the range of all species of rhinoceros.  p 
 p The term  em rhinoceros  em  is sometimes also applied to other, extinct members of the family Rhinocerotidae, a  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary diverse" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="diverse" diverse  a  group that includes several dozen fossil genera, among them the  span id="ref1255408"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal woolly-rhinoceros" class="md-crosslink" woolly rhinoceros  a  ( em Coelodonta antiquitatis  em ). Early rhinoceroses resembled small  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal horse" class="md-crosslink" horses  a  and lacked horns. (Horns are a relatively recent development in the lineage.)
