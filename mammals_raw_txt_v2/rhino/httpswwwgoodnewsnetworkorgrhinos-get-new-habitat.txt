 p There are currently about 4,700 of the critically endangered rhinos, up from a low of nearly 2,100 in the early 1990s.  p 
 p The WWF created the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project to increase the number of black rhinos by moving populations to newly established habitat areas, which helps to increase breeding rates.  p 
 p Growth rates at some range expansion sites have topped 7% per year. Since 2003, the project has translocated 98 black rhinos to 6 different sites resulting in the births of at least 26 calves.  p 
 p As part of its successful range expansion program, WWF will translocate 20 additional black rhinoceros to new landscapes in 2011, according to an agreement with a South African wildlife agency.  p
