 p The name ‘white’ rhino comes from the mispronunciation of the Afrikaans word for ‘wide’ and refers to their wide, flat mouth adapted for grazing. Their horns are used in traditional Far Eastern medicines and for Middle Eastern dagger handles. Southern white rhinoceros have survived due to intense conservation efforts. They have poor eyesight but acute senses of hearing and smell.  p 
 p Rhinoceros horns are made up of matted keratin fibres similar to your hair and nails!  p
