 p Rhino poaching has reached crisis point, and across the globe rhino habitat is shrinking.  p 
 p Rhinos were once found throughout Eurasia and Africa, but today, three of the five rhino species are Critically Endangered, meaning they face a high chance of extinction.  p 
 p In recent years rhino numbers have dropped dramatically due to poaching for their horn which is prized in Asian countries. They also face threats from habitat loss and political conflict. Read about these threats in more detail below.  p 
 p In 2017, 1,028 rhino were brutally murdered for their horn in South Africa alone. That is around three rhino poached a day.   p 
 p Habitat loss is a major threat to rhino populations. Human development has chopped up landscapes where rhinos live, leading to small, isolated populations that cannot get together to breed.  p 
 p In some locations, where there is political instability or war, poachers have found it much easier to kill rhinos and work with criminal gangs who then illegally trade the horn.  p
