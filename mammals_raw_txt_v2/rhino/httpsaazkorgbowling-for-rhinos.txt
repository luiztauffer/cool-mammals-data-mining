 p The AAZK’s  strong Bowling for Rhinos (BFR)  strong  Program provides animal keepers of the world with an avenue to raise funds and awareness for rhino and habitat conservation.  Registration and Sanction information for AAZK Chapters and other event holders is found later in this page.  p 
 p The AAZK Bowling for Rhinos Program connects dedicated individuals with conservation organizations working directly with rhino and their habitats. We provide an avenue for raising funds and awareness to support in situ programs focused on education, protection, population management, and habitat conservation.  p 
 p The AAZK Bowling for Rhinos Program will unite all animal care professionals in raising awareness and funds for the conservation of rhino and their habitats.  p 
 p AAZK realized that the animal keepers of the world were extremely conservation oriented and wanted to help save rhinos and their habitats, yet did not have the financial resources themselves to make any significant impact. That’s when the idea came to start a national bowl-a-thon called Bowling For Rhinos.  p 
 p These fundraisers are organized by volunteers, who donate their time and organizational skills to help raise money to send directly to the places in need. Since all the people involved are volunteers,  strong 100% of all event proceeds and online donations  strong  are sent directly to these in situ rhino conservation areas.  p 
 p Visit the  a href="https:  aazk.org bowling-for-rhinos bowling-for-rhinos-faq " BFR CRG Page  a  for more information  p 
 p AAZK’s Bowling For Rhinos has broken the $7 million mark and we continue to meet our goal of raising approximately $600,000 per year! With our AAZK Chapters and individual donors AAZK continues to make a significant difference in rhino and multi-species conservation.  p
