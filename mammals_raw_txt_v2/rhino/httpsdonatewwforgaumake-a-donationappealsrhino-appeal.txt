 p The world’s last 67 Javan rhinos are fast running out of food.  br 
 br 
The aggressive Arenga palm is growing out of control in critical rhino habitat in Ujung Kulon National Park, Indonesia, blocking out the sun and causing the smaller plants they feed on to die.  br 
 br 
Desperate and hungry, rhinos are moving further and further afield, where they have to compete with other animals for what little food is available.  br 
 br 
It’s been a long, hard fight to keep this tiny population alive. Javan rhinos are clinging on – just – because WWF supporters have defended them from poaching and the effects of illegal logging on their habitat. br 
 br 
We need your urgent help to stop the invasive palm trees that are strangling their food supply - and threatening their very existence.  p 
 p Your donation will help fund community conservation projects, rhino patrol units and sensor cameras.  br

 strong Remove the Arenga palm and plant rhino food   strong  br 
With your support, WWF is aiming to remove 190 hectares of the Arenga Palm and plant native plant species that rhinos love to eat. This will not only be beneficial for the rhinos but will also provide work and support to local communities who will get involved with facilitating this project.  br 
 br 
 strong Fund rhino patrol units   strong  br 
With your help, WWF can train and equip more community monitoring patrols to ensure the long-term viability of the landscape as well as to help monitor Javan rhinos in their habitat.  br 
 br 
 strong Monitor Javan rhinos  strong   br 
With your support, we can set up sensor cameras in critical Javan rhino habitat to help monitor these shy animals. We currently have a few cameras set up, but we desperately need more equipment and data to understand all we can about Javan rhinos.  br 
 br 
 strong With your support to save the last surviving Javan rhinos, you will also help secure a safer future for all the species and communities within the area.  strong   p
