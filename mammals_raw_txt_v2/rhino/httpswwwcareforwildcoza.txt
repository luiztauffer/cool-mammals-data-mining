 p Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary is located on a beautiful game reserve in the heartland of Mpumalanga, South Africa, where weâ€™ve set up a treatment and care centre where we can tend to injured or orphaned animals until they are well enough to be rehabilitated into the wild.  p 
 p Petronel Nieuwoudt, the founder of Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary NPC, is one of the few people worldwide who has specialised in the care of orphaned and injured rhinos, and her passion is truly inspiring.  p 
 p Our mission is to save black and white rhinos from extinction. We are committed to rescue abandoned, injured, and orphaned rhinos and to rehabilitate them wherever possible. We enlist the help of veterinarians, nutritionists, ecologists, and other specialists, to ensure the successful rehabilitation and release of these animals.  p 
 p Over the years, Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary has grown to be the largest rhino sanctuary and orphanage in the world. This has been made possible through hard work, trust, dedication, and good partnerships.  p 
 p Rhino horn cannot be legally sold on the international market. The international trade in rhino horn was banned in 1976 by signatories to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Unfortunately, a flourishing black market trade has led to widespread rhino poaching.  p
