 p audience="advanced intermediate" Historically, northwestern Uganda, southern Chad, south-western Sudan, the eastern part of center African Republic, and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo were the native places for northern white rhinoceroses ( span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species" Ceratotherium simum cottoni  span ). Southern white rhinoceroses ( span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species" Ceratotherium simum simum  span ) were native to all of southern Africa. However, the current range of these subspecies is much more restricted. Presently, northern white rhinoceroses only inhabit the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Whereas, the southern white rhinoceroses inhabit Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast, Kenya, and Zambia.
Furthermore, African governments have been preserving populations of rhinoceroses in protected areas, such as Kruger National Park of South Africa, Mlilwane Game Sanctuary of Swaziland, Murchison Falls National Park of Uganda, and Meru National Park of Kenya.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#33C98C5E-7B4E-11E6-B198-A820662394EA" class="citation" "African rhino.

 p audience="advanced intermediate" The mating system in white rhinoceroses is polygynandrous, meaning both males and females have multiple sexual partners. Male white rhinoceroses are vigilant for females who enter into their territory. Once the female enters the territory, the male remains with the female for a day to investigate whether the female is ready to mate. If the female is ready, then the male usually follows her for 3 to 5 more days, during which time the females responds with snorts and roars. Before mating, pair bonds last for 5 to 20 days; in this period if females attempt to enter another male’s territory, males block the way, and sometimes confrontation occurs between males and females. However, if females successfully enter into another male's territory, then the previous male will discontinue his effort to follow the femal.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Males detect whether females are ready to mate by the smell of urine; urine includes chemicals that signals females in estrus. Females usually experience their first estrus at the age of three and half years, but they don’t breed until age 5. Almost all females breed after 5 years of age. Some of the signs of mating behaviors sent by female rhinoceroses are frequent urination and whistling sounds. Among males of the same population, fecal testosterone levels in territorial males are higher than the non-territorial males. Furthermore, territorial males usually spend more time with females and generally have more mating partners than non-territorial males. Thus, territorial males have higher reproductive success than non-territorial males.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" While mating, male white rhinoceroses place both of their feet on the back of the female. Copulation lasts for 15 to 30 minutes on average, with ejaculations every 4 to 5 minutes. Mating behavior continues for 2 to 5 days as testosterone levels of male are high for 2 to 5 days. After that, the female leaves the male’s territory.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#D3553D7D-78F3-11E6-B808-A820662394EA" class="citation" Estes, 1991  a ;  a href="#D21D51EB-760F-11E6-8F52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Groves, 1972  a ;  a href="#C46C62AE-76B9-11E6-84EA-A820662394EA" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a ;  a href="#E58C4DE8-7903-11E6-AA52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Pienaar, 1994a  a ;  a href="#98320782-7620-11E6-A65A-A820662394EA" class="citation" Rachlow, et al., 1998  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" White rhinoceroses breed throughout the year, but breeding usually peaks between October to December in southern African populations and February to June in eastern African populations. White rhinoceroses give birth to one offspring at a time, which weighs, on average, 48.5 kilograms at birth, and doubles its size by 6 months. Females reach sexual maturity at the age of 3 to 5 years, whereas males reach sexual maturity at the age of 5 to 7 years. Female white rhinoceroses can reproduce from age 5 up to the age of 46 years. The breeding interval in white rhinoceroses is long, 2.5 to 3 years. This long breeding interval is tied to a long gestational period of 530 to 550 days.

Beyond age 6 months, mother still nurse the child and protect them from predators and external threats, such as wildfire. 
Furthermore, calves usually move in front of their mother in the early stage of their life, and they respond immediately when their mothers change direction.

 p audience="advanced intermediate" A common behavior of white rhinoceroses is the way they respond to predators, such as lion ( a class="taxon-link rank-species" href=" accounts Panthera_leo " Panthera leo  a ) attacks. For example, all white rhinoceroses run with their hind feet continuously striking the ground and their forefeet following the direction of the way other rhinos are running, during the flight. White rhinoceroses can run at speeds of 24 km hr, and can reach up to 40 km hr for short periods of time. White rhinoceroses are generally non-aggressive animals. However, females with young calves are more aggressive than the males and other females because they are protective towards their calves. Other common behaviors include the use of mud baths during summer and sand bath during winter. White rhinoceroses rarely take water baths. 
White rhinoceroses are both diurnal and crepuscular and this differs across seasons. During winter, they are diurnal, meaning their peak hours of activities time occur during daytime. On the other hand, white rhinoceroses are crepuscular during summer seasons, with peak hours of activities are between 5 AM to 9 AM and 3 PM to 6:30 PM. This shift is a way to avoid hotter weather in the summer. White rhinoceroses do not migrate from one place to another during different seasons. 
Males rhinoceroses sometimes fight for the territory. Defeated males often move to some other territory. Furthermore, males urinate to determine the boundaries and they leave the territory only when going to get water. White rhinoceroses rarely share the territory with the other rhinoceroses.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#D3553D7D-78F3-11E6-B808-A820662394EA" class="citation" Estes, 1991  a ;  a href="#D21D51EB-760F-11E6-8F52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Groves, 1972  a ;  a href="#98320782-7620-11E6-A65A-A820662394EA" class="citation" Rachlow, et al., 1998  a )  span   p

Home ranges of male rhinoceroses are typically between 0.75 to 13.80 square kilometers, while females occupy 6 to 8 square kilometers The white rhinoceroses have dominance hierarchy, where stronger rhinoceroses claim more territorial space. Male white rhinoceroses actively defend a territory of about 0.7 to 3 square kilometers, on average. Female territories are slightly smaller, on average, 0.5 to 2.3 square kilometers. These rhinoceroses tend to have greater home ranges during dry seasons because they wander more for food in dry seasons than wet seasons.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#D3553D7D-78F3-11E6-B808-A820662394EA" class="citation" Estes, 1991  a ;  a href="#D21D51EB-760F-11E6-8F52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Groves, 1972  a ;  a href="#C46C62AE-76B9-11E6-84EA-A820662394EA" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a ;  a href="#E58C4DE8-7903-11E6-AA52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Pienaar, 1994a  a ;  a href="#CCF880A8-76B2-11E6-9C63-A820662394EA" class="citation" Pienaar, 1994b  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" White rhinoceroses communicate using several different noises. Typically, male white rhinoceroses are louder than females. In addition, during fights with other bulls, males make grunts and snorts. Females utter a loud bass bellow while fighting with other females or in confrontation with males. Panting, whining, and squeaking are the sounds made by calves if they do not see their mother. White rhinoceroses often make gruff squeaking sounds when chasing or being chased, and their defensive sound is snarling. Male rhinoceroses make hic-throbbing sounds when approaching females.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" White rhinoceroses are nearsighted, but they have heightened senses of hearing and smell. Therefore, olfactory communications play an major role in securing their territories. In white rhinoceros populations, dominant males spray their urine to mark the boundaries of their territories. Furthermore, white rhinoceroses have communal dung heaps, which makes it easier for rhinoceroses to identify each other in an area. Communal dung heaps also play a role in mating, because males can determine if a female is prepared to mate based on the smell of the dung.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#D3553D7D-78F3-11E6-B808-A820662394EA" class="citation" Estes, 1991  a ;  a href="#D21D51EB-760F-11E6-8F52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Groves, 1972  a ;  a href="#C46C62AE-76B9-11E6-84EA-A820662394EA" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a ;  a href="#E8993C8A-7617-11E6-96C4-A820662394EA" class="citation" Skinner and Chimimba, 2006  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" White rhinoceroses are mega-herbivores that graze on vast amount of grasses. White rhinoceroses also are considered as keystone species because they help to increase the biodiversity of grasses and potentially prevent the wildfires. Waldram et al.

However, the discovery of four southern white rhinoceroses in Zululand, present-day South Africa, in 1883, proved that southern white rhinoceroses were not extinct but a critically endangered species. Since the 1950s, conservation practices have been applied, along with strong conservation laws passed by governments. However, the situation worsened after internal conflicts and civil wars arose in some African countries, which drastically decreased the white rhinoceroses’ population during late 1970s and 1980s. To conserve these rhinoceroses, individuals were relocated to different parks, such as Kruger National Park, South Africa. Relocation of southern white rhinoceroses has been extremely successful, as numbers grew from 337 to 1876 in the span of 20 years (1973 to 1993).

Northern white rhinoceroses inhabit in the poor and undeveloped northern countries of Africa, such as Sudan, Chad, and Uganda. As a result of weak regulations and weak centralized governments, poaching of northern white rhinoceroses has intensified. The numbers of northern white rhinoceroses decreased from 500 in 1968 to four in 2015. These four northern white rhinoceroses are in captivity and it has been hypothesized that there are not any northern white rhinoceroses left in the wild.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" White rhinoceroses’ populations have declined because of illegal poaching by humans for horns. These horns are made of keratin and are not useful for any kind of medications. However, people, mostly from China and eastern Asia, still use the horns for their traditional medication, which science considers pseudo-medicine. In attempt to preserve rhinoceroses, CITES, in 1977, banned international trades of all rhinoceroses. Despite the effort by CITES, the illegal killing and trading of rhinoceroses continued. The failure of CITES to limit trade gave rise to the new trade regulations, like Resolution Conf 6.10, made by the United Nations. This resolution, made in 1981, prohibited any international national sale or trade of the rhinoceroses’ horn and skin. The resolution also encouraged that governments destroy the stocks of rhinoceros horns. However, countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia opposed the international ban on trades of rhinoceroses’ products because these countries had horns of rhinoceroses that were collected by arresting the poachers.  p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" In 1994, the United States threatened to ban the trade of any wildlife and fisheries with the countries that did not follow the international trade bans. In response to the U.S. threat, countries such as South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia explored alternate approaches to conserving rhinoceroses, so that they could continue international trade. The conservation practices applied by these countries were “dethroning” the horns of rhinoceroses (preemptively cutting off the horns, at no immediate harm to the individuals) and erecting fencing. Fences around the forest where rhinoceroses reside, plus armed guards, has been an effective conservation practice. Furthermore, safe dethroning techniques have reduced poaching efforts.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#2484A9AE-78F8-11E6-9C2C-A820662394EA" class="citation" Ferreira, et al., 2015  a ;  a href="#D21D51EB-760F-11E6-8F52-A820662394EA" class="citation" Groves, 1972  a ;  a href="#AEBFACB0-78F6-11E6-B210-A820662394EA" class="citation" Rachlow and Berger, 1997  a ;  a href="#E5F31EAB-76B3-11E6-B8A1-A820662394EA" class="citation" Rachlow, 1997  a ;  a href="#FD4B0528-9D27-11E6-9F7E-A820662394EA" class="citation" Sara, 2003  a )  span   p
