 p    p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong  em Background:  em   strong   span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" On 20 December 2013, at its 68th session, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed  strong  em 3 March, the day of signature of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as UN World Wildlife Day  em   strong  to celebrate and raise awareness of the world’s wild animals and plants.  span   p 
 p    p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong  em About CITES:  em   strong   span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The  strong  em Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)  em   strong  is an  strong  em international regulatory treaty between 183 party states  em   strong .  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" It was  strong  em formed in 1973 and regulates the international trade in over 35,000 wild species of plants and animals  em   strong .  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The focus of the convention is not solely on the protection of species. It  strong  em also promotes controlled trade that is not detrimental to the sustainability of wild species  em   strong .  span   p 
 p    p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong  em How does CITES work?  em   strong   span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The convention works primarily through a system of classification and licensing.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Wild species are  strong  em categorised in Appendices I to III  em   strong . This often reflects species’ threat status on the Red List of the IUCN, the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species first created in 1964.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong  em National CITES management authorities  em   strong  may issue permits once scientific authorities show non-detriment findings. In other words, scientific evidence must demonstrate that species sustainability will not be adversely affected by trade. Where data is lacking, the precautionary principle applies.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong  em CITES is legally binding  em   strong  on state parties to the convention, which are obliged to adopt their own domestic legislation to implement its goals.  span   p

 p  span style="color: #000000;" The findings were based on a study of the health records of 250,000 people in Haryana (which sees a spike in crop burning episodes in winter), and Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which don’t see similar burning episodes.
