In fact it looks like a cross between all three! It is  reddish brown with a very thick ringed tail. Red pandas lives in Asia  and shares some of its habitat with the giant panda.   p 
 p  They both  share some similar lifestyle facts. Both animals like to eat bamboo,  although the red panda will supplement its diet and eat addition foods  when available. They are both solitary creatures and endangered. They  even share breeding and reproduction characteristics. Despite all of  their similarities, the red panda family classification is Ailuridae.  p 
 p  Information on their life cycle in the wild is not complete. The red  panda is also known as the lesser panda, fire cat, small red panda, and  western red panda.   p 
 p  The red panda  lives, eats, and raises its babies in forest mountain terrains. Its  habitat range includes central China, Nepal, Myanmar(Burma), and  Bhutan. Precise information on their habitat distribution is not known  since wild population facts are difficult to gather.   p 
 p  Once living in many parts of Asia including greater China, the red  panda is now confined to parceled territories that collectively are a  fraction of its original habitat. These isolated parcels interfere with  feeding, migration, and breeding activities.   p 
 p  Many facts  indicate that reproduction rates are on the decline. The foods it must  eat to maintain its lifestyle and reproduction cycle have been reduced  by habitat loss, global warming, hunting, and poaching. Their greatest  threat is therefore mankind.   p 
 p  Research facts show many baby red  pandas do not survive to adulthood. The red panda is classified as  endangered. In fact it is now extinct in several countries according to  information from conservation groups.  p

Adults lead solitary lives.  However this endangered species has been observed to be more social  prior to reproduction cycles.   p 
 p  They are active from dusk to  dawn and their primary habitat is above the ground in trees. In fact  they breed and sleep in trees. A major characteristic is the ability to  traverse tree branches easily.   p 
 p  These pandas like to eat, clean  themselves, mate, and sleep. Life style of this animal includes a lot  of play and mischief. Baby red pandas are energetic from the start.   p 
 p  Bamboo is the main diet of the red panda and is abundant in its natural  habitat. However it will also eat a variety of other foods such as  fruits, nuts, eggs, flowers, and seeds.   p 
 p  Information from their  droppings reveal additional diet facts, such as their taste for other  prey such as rodents and small birds.   p 
 p  Red panda cubs eat  bamboo until they are mature enough to expand their diet. Their bamboo  ranges are endangered and threaten the life style of this unique  species.  p 
 p  Breeding season is in the  late fall through winter. The gestation period is about four months.  Baby red pandas are born in an average litter size of one to four  babies and are born in the late spring and summer.   p 
 p  They build  a nest or use hollow tree trunks or small caves to give birth to their  newborn. The mother red panda takes care of her cubs until they reach  adulthood when the next mating season begins.   p 
 p  After birth  adulthood is reached in 16 to 18 months. At 18 months both male and  female are ready to mate and repeat the reproduction process.  p
