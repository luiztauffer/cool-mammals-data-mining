 p Giant pandas at Shanghai Zoo will have a better living environment soon as the expansion project for their pavilion is slated for completion in mid-April.  p 
 p The zoo started to plan for the renovation project as early as in September. When completed, the new pavilion will have a 300-square-meter indoor space and feature a new monitoring room, a medical treatment room, a weighing room and a feeding room for the animal. The space of the animal cages will be increased to 60 sq m.  p 
 p The 600-sq-m outdoor space of the pavilion is also being renovated.  p 
 p The zoo currently houses Ya'er, a 5-year-old male panda, after his cousin Xing'er was sent back to the national reserve in Southwest China's Sichuan province earlier this year.  p 
 p The zoo said that the renovation project will not have an impact on Ya'er which still lives in the pavilion.  p
