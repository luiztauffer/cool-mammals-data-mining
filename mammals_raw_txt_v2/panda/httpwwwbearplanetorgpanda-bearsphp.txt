Probably no animal in history has gone so far toward capturing the hearts of human beings as the plumpish, 
clumsy, but loveable looking creature called the Giant Panda and many debates have taken place as to whether pandas 
were really bears, or were in fact  a href="http:  www.bearplanet.org raccoon.php" raccoons  a , which they also resemble in many aspects.  
Genetic analyses recently carried out has indicated that the giant panda is closer genetically to bears whereas 
 a href="http:  www.bearplanet.org red-panda.php" the red panda  a  
is closer to  a href="http:  www.bearplanet.org raccoon.php" raccoons  a ....

The panda bear has been loved by children and toy makers worldwide, and sought after by photographers, 
zoologists and hunters everywhere. Since its official discovery in the remote, mountainous regions of western China
 over a century ago, the Giant Panda has intrigued and baffled naturalists like no other animal.

 p  b  u The giant panda  u   b  (scientific name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca), sometimes referred to as the black-and-white cat-foot, 
                   	is a mammal belonging to the bear family, or Ursidae. 
                   	The Ailuropodinae is the oldest family of the most
                   	 primitive lineage of bears and the fossils of the oldest ancestral panda, Ailuropoda lufengensesis, which 
                   	 are found in southern China, are about 8 million years old.

                   	The Giant Panda is believed to be not only a genuine member of the bear family, but also the 
                   	 only living representative of the family Ailuropoda that is known to exist.  
                   	 Comparative blood-protein tests and recent 
                   	 molecular-genetic analysis have indicated that, while the giant panda branched off independently on 
                   	 the evolutionary tree, it is indeed closer to the bear family than to the raccoon. 
                   	        	  br  br 
                   	Although the panda bear lives wild in a very restricted geographical area of China,
                   	 it is the symbol of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and also an internationally protected species.

The existence of this puzzling animal was first revealed in 1869 when a French missionary naturalist, 
                   	Pere Jean Pierre Armand David, astonished fellow scientists by sending back to Paris a description, 
                   	pelt and skeleton of a new species he named Ursus melanoleucus or "black white bear". 
                   		 br 	 br 
                   		He concluded that 
                   	they more closely resembled those of a much smaller animal known to occupy the same territory: 
                   	the red panda which looked like a cross between a raccoon and a fox, but revealed its primary 
                   	ancestry with a raccoon-like body and facial stripes and long ringed tail.

                   	The stronghold of 
                   	the Giant Panda is the formidable vastness of the Easter Himalayas close to the Chinese-Tibetan border, 
                   	a vast wilderness of jagged peaks thrusting 20,000 feet in the air above cavernous valleys and 
                   	torrential mountain streams.
