 p Climate data are particularly important in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) that are used for predicting global warming consequences on plant and animal distributions. A number of the plants and animals, especially the endangered species such as the giant panda ( i Ailuropoda melanolecua  i ), are limited in their scope of distribution due to climate changes. Thus, predicting the habitat quality distribution under climate change is important for protecting these species. In this paper the existing and potential habitats of the giant pandas are used as the study area, the calculated Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) maps in 1989 and 2002, and climate change data in 1989, 2002, 2050 and 2099 from the IPCC are used as the data sources. A multivariable linear regression model for mapping HSI is created with the regressive results in 2002 and 1989. The HSIs of the study area in 2050 and 2099 were then mapped with the model. These maps indicate that, from 2002 to 2050, about 2.64% of the unsuitable habitat in the study area will become suitable, while about 1.5% of the suitable habitat will turn into unsuitable habitat. This leads to an increase of the suitable habitat area on the whole from 2050 to 2099: about 3.43% of the unsuitable habitat will become suitable, while about 6.59% of the suitable habitat will turn into unsuitable habitat, which leads to a decrease of the suitable habitat area on the whole. From the suitable habitat distribution, it can be seen that the suitable habitat of giant pandas gradually moves north under projected global climate change.

 p Climate change usually refers to the change over time in variables such as temperature, precipitation and wind, with increases in temperature being a particular focus. Undeniably, climate changes are not simply a phenomenon of the future, but also of the relatively recent past, as well as of the present (Hope,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0006" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2009  a   span ). Climate change over the last 30 years has produced numerous shifts in species distributions and abundance and has been implicated in one species‐level extinction (Thomas  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0016" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2004  a   span ; Mesev,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2007  a   span ). Climate change is the key to biodiversity nowadays: most biodiversity studies assess the impacts of climate change and associated habitat fragmentation ( span  a href="#met1376-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" IPCC, 2007a; IPCC, 2007b  a   span ; de Chazal and Rounsevell,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2009  a   span ; Guan,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0004" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2009  a   span ). Biodiversity or biological diversity variously refers to diversity at the genetic, species or ecosystem levels. In the context of climate change, biodiversity is typically associated with species, most often referring to native or endemic species richness or species diversity (including species number and relative abundance) (de Chazal and Rounsevell,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0002" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2009  a   span ; Durner  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0003" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2009  a   span ).
           p 
 p The giant panda ( i Ailuropoda melanolecua  i ) is a peculiar and endangered animal. It is the mark of the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and also the national treasure in China. Since the 1950s it has been designated as a top priority for species protection in China. In the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries the giant panda habitat was widely distributed in southwestern China, including Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces (Zhang  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0021" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2007  a   span ). With the human population expansion, agriculture and transportation development, however, the giant pandas now only live in the southern Qinling mountain systems of southeastern Shanxi province, the Minshan mountain systems of the southern Gansu province, the northwestern part of Sichuan province, and the Qionglai, Xiangling and Liangshan mountain systems located in the west of Sichuan province. Comparing the data from the third National Survey (1999–2003) to the data from the second National Survey (1985–1988), it is found that the giant panda's distribution area has been expanded from 11 to 45 counties. Between these last two surveys, the giant panda's habitat also expanded by 43.27%, to about 23 050 km sup 2  sup  and the giant panda's population increased by 65.7% to about 1596 in 2002 (Jian  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0009" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2011  a   span ). The continuing decline in the giant panda's population and habitat area has been preliminarily held back, and the survival environment is improving (National‐Forest‐Ministry,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0012" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2006  a   span ). However, because of the large human population, recessive economy, poor facilities and climate change in the distribution area of the giant pandas, no one can be certain how the giant panda's population, habitat or distribution will change (Ouyang  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2000  a   span ).
           p 
 p The quality of the giant panda's habitat is mainly based on the land cover of the giant panda's distribution area, and land cover change is seriously affected by climate change (Hietel  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0005" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2005  a   span ). However, the dynamic interaction, which involves a large number of difficult‐to‐predict variables, between giant panda habitat quality and external climate, is extremely complex. Thus, the use of habitat quality simulation techniques, together with forecasting weather data, are necessary to study the impact of climate change on the giant panda habitat quality (Zhou,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0022" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2005  a   span ; Zhang  i et al  i ., 2006; Zhang  i et al  i ., 2007).
           p 
 p In this paper, in order to simplify the study of climate change's influence on the quality of giant panda's habitat, the anthropogenic influences are assumed to be static. The genetic alteration of the giant panda to climate change is also considered to be small and climate change is considered as the only driver of giant panda habitat quality. Thus, the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) maps in 2002, 1989, 2050 and 2099, which are calculated on the climate change data (WCRP CMIP3 multi‐model dataset with double flux of CO sub 2  sub ) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ( span  a href="#met1376-bib-0007" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" IPCC, 2007a; IPCC 2007b  a   span ) with a multivariable linear regression model, are presented. With these maps, giant panda habitat changes in 50 and 100 years can be perceived. The present paper is significant for two reasons. First, it provides a scientific basis for strengthening the protection of existing giant panda habitat. Many scholars have thoroughly studied giant panda habitat, but nobody has made a prediction of the changes of giant panda habitat. Therefore, the trend of giant panda habitat remains unclear. Second, this paper is a guide to adjusting and optimizing the existing nature reserves. Some nature reserves are too small to be used effectively by giant pandas and some are divided into several parts that degrade their function, due to the separated local administration.
           p 
 p In this paper, a more than 30 km range buffer to the giant panda distribution area, excepting the Qinling mountain systems, from the three national surveys is used as the study area (Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0001" 1  a ). This area has a longitude range of 101 ° 19 ′–109 ° 10 ′ E and a latitude range of 27 ° 52 ′–34 ° 18 ′ N. The study area covers all the distribution areas of the 3 separate giant panda species groups, including 3 counties of Gansu Province, 1 county of Yunnan Province and more than 30 counties of Sichuan Province.
              p 
 p This area is an expansion of the current and historical habitat. It is located in the transition area from the Sichuan Basin to the Qinghai‐Tibet Plateau. This area is also characterized by mountainous ravines and is sparsely populated, which is suitable for the survival of the giant panda physiologically. However, from Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0001" 1  a (a), the most part of the giant panda habitat is in highly threatened ecoregions, which means that its ecological system is weak and tends to be destroyed.
              p 
 p Climatic variables derived from IPCC's climate database (WCRP CMIP3 multi‐model dataset with double flux of CO sub 2  sub ) are used in this paper. The change maps of annual precipitation mean, annual temperature mean and annual relative humidity mean from 1989 to 2099 on about 1 km sup 2  sup  resolution grid (0.0085° × 0.0085°) are shown in Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0002" 2  a . The precipitation has changed little from 1989 to 2002. It increases a lot for all points from 2002 to 2050, but only a little for all points from 2050 to 2099. The relative humidity has a different situation, in that it has been low from 1989 to 2002 and then rises from 2002 to 2050, but lowers from 2050 to 2099. Temperature is predicted to rise continuously from 1989 to 2099.
              p 
 p A Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) is a conceptual model that relates measurable environmental variables to the suitability of a site for a species (Brooks,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0001" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 1997  a   span ; Vinagre  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0017" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2006  a   span ; Vincenzi  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0018" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2007  a   span ). HSI values are a combination of environmental variables, each of them represented by a suitability index (SI) and typically scaled from 0 (unsuitable habitat) to 1 (suitable habitat). Aside from habitat, various factors may determine animal presence or abundance. Measurements of habitat suitability may include a limited number of factors that determine population levels. Thus, the HSI for a species at a location indicates relative habitat quality rather than actual population levels. HSI models attempt to quantify habitat quality using habitat attributes considered important to the wildlife species (Rüger  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0015" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2005  a   span ). According to the literature on the giant panda's ecology and behaviour, the three national surveys on giant panda population and habitat (National‐Forest‐Ministry,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0012" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2006  a   span ) and the analysis of the habitat characteristics, the factors influencing the giant panda's habitat can be divided into three types: physical environmental factors, biological factors and human‐influence factors (Ouyang  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0013" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2000  a   span ; Zhang  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0020" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2006  a   span ,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0021" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2007  a   span ; Ran  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0014" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2006  a   span ). Spatial processing was used to calculate HSI, and elevation, slope and aspect are selected as the physical environmental factors, vegetation distribution is selected as the ecological factor and distances to highways, general roads, inhabitants and rural areas are selected as the human‐influence factors. Each factor is reclassified by grid‐cell to the suitability index scale (e.g. elevation in metres was converted to a 0–1 suitability scale) based on habitat affinities of giant pandas that are derived from published information on their biology as well as on the survey data from the three national surveys. The spatial processing of the suitability index values is calculated by grid cell overlaying on the environmental maps and this resulted in a map of the composite HSI value (Jian  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2012  a   span ).
              p 
 p By using the existed and potential giant panda habitats as the study area, the Landsat ETM data contemporary with the third National Survey and the data from the third National Survey used as the main data source, the HSI map of 2002 was calculated first (Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0003" 3  a (a)). By using Landsat TM data and the second National Survey data, the HSI map for 1989 was calculated (Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0003" 3  a (b)) (Jian  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0010" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2012  a   span ). In addition, the giant panda density maps for 1989 and 2002, calculated by the Kernel density estimation method, were obtained for analysis and assessing calculated habitat suitability index results (Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0004" 4  a ).
              p 
 p An animal's habitat selection is the result of evolutionary and behavioural factors (i.e. behavioural factors related to the habitat, including biological and non‐biological). In the long‐term evolutionary process, although the giant panda has undergone genetic selection in response to the environment this is not strictly hereditary. It alters with the relationship in and between the species and the environment, changes in ecology and many other factors (Yang  i et al  i .,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0019" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2006  a   span ). Thus, in the present paper, because the HSI is a composite index, only climate change is taken into account, assuming it is the main factor altering the quality of giant panda habitat. Moreover, it is assumed that the effect is linear and we can establish a linear regressive equation between climate and HSI.
              p 
 p In order to obtain the regressive model, 360 sample points were randomly chosen in the study area, as shown in Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0002" 2  a . With the calculated HSI values and the IPCC's climate database, the HSI values ( i y  i ), yearly temperature mean ( i x  i 1, unit: °C), yearly relative humid mean ( i x  i 2, %) and yearly precipitation mean ( i x  i 3, unit: mm) for 2002 of all the 360 sample points were obtained (the values are too many to be shown in a table). A regressive equation, as Equation  a class="equationLink scrollableLink" href="#met1376-disp-0001" title="Link to equation" 1  a , can then be obtained on these points with a interception standard error of 0.03. Thus, the regressive result for 2002 can be obtained with the equation, shown as Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (a).

                 p 
 p As the calculated HSI is regressed by the unique combination of climate covariates, it has some bias to the actual value. Therefore, the preliminary HSI maps calculated by linear regressive model cannot be used directly to assess the habitat quality. Thus, a giant panda density map of 2002 was used to revise the model. In Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0004" 4  a , giant panda distribution is not even, it changes from 0 to 0.155  i per  i  km sup 2  sup . Assuming that giant pandas only reach the area with a density of more than 0.001  i per  i  km sup 2  sup , the suitable area for giant pandas shown as Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (b). Comparing Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (a) with (b) shows that the maximum, minimum, mean and median of Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (a) are 0.84236, 0.0000075, 0.341 and 0.33563, respectively, while in Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0007" 7  a  these values are 0.77555, 0.026777, 0.378 and 0.38069, respectively. Taking the human influences and differences into account, the regressive result can reflect the giant panda habitat quality status in 2002. Assuming that 50% of the suitable area was the area favoured by giant pandas, it is found that the area with the regressive value between 0.2410 and 0.5884 is the giant panda's favoured area, with 0.2410 and 0.5884 being the assumed thresholds. Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (c) is the revised regressive result. Comparing Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (c) and (a), it can be seen that Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0005" 5  a (c) is more similar to Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0003" 3  a (a).
              p 
 p Though the calculated model fits well with the giant panda density map in 2002, the model needs to be assessed first to enable its use in prediction. Thus, the 1989 map is selected to assess the model. First, the model is used to monitor the habitat quality of 1989 and Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0006" 6  a (a) is the regressive result. Also, the calculated HSI map and giant panda density map of 1989 are shown as Figures  a href="#met1376-fig-0003" 3  a (b) and   a href="#met1376-fig-0004" 4  a (b). The thresholds, derived from 2002, are assumed to remain fixed. Thus, the regressive result is revised by selecting the value between 0.2410 and 0.5884. Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0006" 6  a (b) is the revised regressive result in 1989. Comparing Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0006" 6  a (b) with Figures  a href="#met1376-fig-0006" 6(a), 3  a ,  a href="#met1376-fig-0003" 6(a), 3  a (b) and  a href="#met1376-fig-0004" 4  a (b), it can be seen that Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0006" 6  a (b) has the same pattern as Figures  a href="#met1376-fig-0003" 3  a (b) and  a href="#met1376-fig-0004" 4  a (b).
              p 
 p Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0007" 7  a (a) is the change map of calculated habitat from 1989 to 2002. In the map, the suitable habitat increases by 2.67% while decreasing by 11.77%, but much of the decrease is because of development of plain area, which is not suitable for giant panda due to human activities.
              p 
 p In order to simplify the results, we selected 2050 and 2099 to map the habitat change. Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0008" 8  a (a) and (b) show the regressive results calculated by the model above for 2050 and 2099. Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0008" 8  a (c) and (d) show the revised results from Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0008" 8  a (a) and (b), respectively. Inherently, this approach assumes that in the future the these will select habitats in the same way as they did in 2002, despite potential human disturbance of land cover.
              p 
 p Percentage changes of optimal habitat area are used to quantify 21 sup st  sup  Century changes and trends in the study area. Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0007" 7  a (b) and (c) show the changing habitat map from 2002 to 2050 and 2050 to 2099, respectively. To understand giant panda habitat trend it is helpful to consider the general trends of climate change. From 2002 to 2050, the temperature will rise by 1–2 °C (shown in Figure  a href="#met1376-fig-0002" 2  a (c)), the humidity will climb by 10–20% and the precipitation will increase substantially, judging from the statistics: these changes lead to some changes in the habitat. About 2.64% of unsuitable habitats will become suitable habitat, while about 1.50% of suitable habitat will turn into unsuitable habitat. Thus, the whole suitable habitat area will increase to some extent. In Figures  a href="#met1376-fig-0002" 2  a  and  a href="#met1376-fig-0008" 8  a (c), the higher temperature will spur the biomass, causing the unsuitable habitat to change into suitable habitat in the southwest corner in of the study area map. However, increased precipitation will change the micro‐environment, leading to the suitable habitat changing to unsuitable habitat in the northeast part of the study area. The situation is not the same from 2050 to 2099. During this period, the temperature will rise by a further 1–3 °C, humidity will decrease and the precipitation will remain stable. This will cause about 3.43% of unsuitable habitat to become suitable, while about 6.59% of suitable habitat will turn unsuitable. Thus, the whole suitable habitat area will decrease. The temperature is too high and the humidity decrease will reduce the biomass in the southwest corner of the study area, causing the suitable habitat to change into unsuitable habitat, but suitable temperature and stable precipitation will raise the biomass in the northeast part of the study area, leading to the formation of suitable habitat (Figures  a href="#met1376-fig-0002" 2  a  and  a href="#met1376-fig-0008" 8  a (d)). With the trend analysis above, some general results can be obtained that climate changes have an active influence on the giant panda habitat in the early stage, mainly due to the temperature rising. However, with the climate change become more pronounced it will have a positive effect on giant panda habitat and the suitable habitat development will have a trend from south to north.
              p 
 p An understanding of the environmental factors that determine species distributions (type, abundance, level of diversity) has always been of great interest in ecological research, but its importance has increased along with interest in studying the consequences of changing environmental conditions (Mesev,  span  a href="#met1376-bib-0011" class="bibLink tab-link" data-tab="pane-pcw-references" 2007  a   span ). Focussing on the quality of the giant panda habitats and based on climate change data of the IPCC, the forecast results of changes in the giant panda habitats in 2050 and 2099 have been calculated using a regressive method. By calculating the habitat suitability index (HSI) in the study area in 1989, 2050 and 2099 using IPCC climate data, the forecasts can be used as a database that helps to understand generally and predict the quality of the giant panda's habitat. The multivariable linear regression model is selected to calculate the HSI in 1989, 2050 and 2099, and the regressive result is based on the data from the second and the third National (giant panda) Surveys. The study area includes existing and potential habitat, thus the forecasting results can serve as basic data for understanding habitat expansion. With the HSI calculated in Section  a class="sectionLink scrollableLink" href="#met1376-sec-0010" 3.1.  a , the changing tendency of the giant panda habitat quality can be deduced. Generally speaking, the quality of the habitat of giant pandas gradually turns worse with climate change.
           p 
 p The habitats are the foundation for the giant pandas to survive and to multiply, and the potential habitat is the hope for population development. Therefore, work should start to strengthen the protection of current and potential habitats. From the predicted result, it is suggested that more nature reserves should be created in Minshan mountain systems. Above all, only the climate changes of the giant panda habitat areas were taken into account in this study, but in reality human activity and landscape fragmentation also have a great impact on the giant panda's habitat. Thus, in subsequent work, the impact of human activity and landscape fragmentation on the giant panda habitat will be investigated, to further support useful and strategic decisions of its protection.  p
