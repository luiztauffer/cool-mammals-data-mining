  strong Three red pandas live in the  a href="https:  detroitzoo.org press-release detroit-zoos-latest-major-habitat-expansion-unveiled " Holtzman Wildlife Foundation Red Panda Forest  a : male Ravi, born in 2016;  female Ash, born in 2015; and female Ta-Shi, born in 2005. The habitat features more than 14,000 square feet of naturalistic space with a flowing stream and waterfall, an arboreal pathway through the habitat, misting areas to cool the red pandas in the summer, land for exploration and a variety of nesting places. A rope bridge extends 80 feet through the trees in the red pandas’ habitat and provides unparalleled views of these arboreal animals for adventurous guests.  p 
 p  strong Description br 
  strong As their name suggests, red pandas’ fur is mostly rusty-red color. They have white markings on their ears, cheeks, muzzles and above their eyes. Their bushy tails are ringed with light and dark variations of the rusty-red color. Their fur also covers the soles of their feet to help give them traction and prevent them from falling off slippery, wet branches.  p 
 p The red panda, like the giant panda, has an extended wrist bone that acts like a thumb and allows it to easily hold onto bamboo.  p 
 p In the past, the red panda has been classified as a relative to the raccoon and the giant panda. Now, it is listed as its own scientific family – the Ailuridae.  p
