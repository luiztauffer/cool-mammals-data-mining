 p Where can you go that has water to drink, food, a place to sleep, and provides shelter from the outdoors? This place is your home, and it's your habitat. It has everything you need to survive.   p 
 p Can you imagine being stranded in a thick bamboo forest? Will it have everything that you need to survive, like your home? No, but it is the ideal habitat for pandas!   p 
 p Bamboo forests are the natural habitat of the giant  b panda  b , a black and white bear that lives in China. In bamboo forests, pandas have the water they need, food to eat, a place to sleep, and shelter. An animal's  b habitat  b  is the place where it lives and that provides all that the animal needs to survive.   p 
 p The giant panda's habitat is located on the continent of Asia. Pandas live on high mountains filled with large bamboo forests in the middle of China. The mountainous areas are present in a few of the country's provinces, but the majority of pandas live in Sichuan Province, nicknamed 'The Home of the Giant Panda.'   p 
 p Pandas didn't always live in the mountains. In fact, they used to live in the lowlands of China, but the trees and forests in the lowlands were destroyed by humans. Because of this, pandas were forced to move higher into the mountains where they now live. The mountains in which the pandas live are usually cloudy and have heavy, strong rains all year long.   p

 p The Chinese government is now working to save pandas' habitats in the mountains, especially since they're an  b endangered species  b , which means they're at risk of extinction. The number of pandas in the world is getting smaller and smaller, putting them in danger of dying out forever.   p 
 p Bamboo is 99% of the pandas' food, and because they're big bears, they have to eat a lot of it! Even though bamboo makes up most of a panda's diet, they are technically omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. This other 1% of a panda's diet may include fish or small prey like rodents.   p 
 p To get all the food they need, pandas can eat bamboo for up to 12 hours straight every day! This is how they maintain their large weights, since they hardly eat meat. Since bamboo is at least 50% water, pandas get much of the water they need from their food, too. They also drink fresh water from streams and rivers.   p 
 p An animal's  b habitat  b  is the place where it lives and that provides all that the animal needs to survive, and a  b panda  b  is a black and white bear that lives in the high mountains in central China. Giant pandas live in bamboo forests in these mountains and almost completely depend on bamboo for both food and water. This endangered species used to live in the lowlands of China, but moved to the mountains when their homes were destroyed by humans.  p
