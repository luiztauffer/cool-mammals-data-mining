 p During our China unit we study the panda bear and learn a bit about it's life cycle.  The children love seeing the newborn panda photos – so pink and appears hairless!  I think it is important to have the children create the habitat of the animal we are studying.  It brings multiple sensory learning which gives ownership to the knowledge they have.  It is also a great demonstration of what they have learned.  Finally, it gives a tool of conversation at home – that they can show the family and tell them what they have learned!  p
