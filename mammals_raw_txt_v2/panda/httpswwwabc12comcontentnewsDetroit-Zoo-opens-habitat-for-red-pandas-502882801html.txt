 p The Holtzman Wildlife Foundation Red Panda Forest made its debut this month at the zoo in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak.   p 
 p It's designed to provide a larger and more stimulating naturalistic environment for the pandas.  p 
 p And it seeks to help teach people more about the animals.  p 
 p The zoo is home to three red pandas.  p 
 p A $500,000 gift from the Holtzman Wildlife Foundation helped fund the roughly $800,000 project.  p 
 p The habitat has been expanded and features a flowing stream, a larger pathway through the habitat and misting areas to cool the red pandas in the summer.   p 
 p A new rope bridge extends 80 feet (24 meters) through the trees and provides new views of the animals for zoo visitors. br   p
