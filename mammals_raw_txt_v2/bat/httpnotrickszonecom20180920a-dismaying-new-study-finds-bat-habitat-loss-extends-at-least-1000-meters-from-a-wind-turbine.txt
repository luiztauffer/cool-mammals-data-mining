 p As I have previously stated. br 
Wind turbines are bat-bursting, bird-bashing, uneconomical, grid-destabilising ecocrucifixes that also fail in their primary role to reduce CO2 emissions. br 
Yet we continue to build these monstrosities. br 
Why? br 
To assuage the cult of AGW and to fill the pockets of green scamsters at the expense of the poor. br 
PS, br 
DNCWTRT  p 
 p Yet we continue to build these monstrosities. br 
Why?  p 
 p Because there aren‚Äôt big animal killing machines as you guys are imagining them them to be. They are getting economical fast (last invitation of tenders in Germany resulted in an average price of 6.16 cent kWh in August), the grid didn‚Äôt get unstable because of them yet and they massively reduce CO2 emissions.  p 
 p Basically: you‚Äôve got everything wrong.  p 
 p You‚Äôre ignoring all the disadvantages that outweigh. If what you said were true, Germany would not have slowed down their installation.  p 
 p Because there aren‚Äôt big animal killing machines as you guys are imagining them them to be.  p 
 p Are you denying that wind turbines destroy bat habitats and kill about 3-5 million bats a year?  p 
 p  em ‚ÄúAre you denying that wind turbines destroy bat habitats and kill about 3-5 million bats a year?‚Äù  em   p 
 p He just DOESN‚ÄôT CARE.  p 
 p I would like to know what the effect on nuclear and coal power industrial development would be if nuclear radiation or coal emission had the same effect on these vulnerable members of the order Chiroptera  p 
 p Nuclear and coal power have certain other effects you are likely ignoring since you probably think AGW is a scam hoax.  p 
 p There is ZERO EVIDENCE that CO2 causes warming, seb  p 
 p So its not a matter of belief, strong  its a matter of SCIENCE that AGW is a scam.  strong   p
