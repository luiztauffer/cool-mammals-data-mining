 p  strong Please note, the Fruit Bat Forest will be closed on Wednesday 6 March for a check up the Fruit Bats. Maintenance work will also be taking place on 11 March.  strong   p 
 p Get up close to our colony of bats as they go about their nightly business. These impressive flying mammals spend their time flying, eating, mating and generally conducting their daily lives all under the cloak of darkness.  p 
 p As you make your way through the forest and head towards the bat cave, you may be able to feel the air as they whoosh past you! But there’s no need to worry about them flying into you, bats are excellent navigators.  p 
 p It’s a great opportunity to discover what these animals get up to when we’re usually tucked up in bed; we’ve switched the lighting around so it’s night-time for the bats in the day, and daytime during the night.  p 
 p 
					We're open from 10am till 4.30pm, with last entry 30 minutes before closing.
