 p Rare Animals of India is a unique book that presents the biological and ecological accounts of the least known animal species of India in one comprehensive volume. The book gives comprehensive ecological accounts supported with data tables on rare and specific animal species of India and discusses the basis for their rarity for their conservation. It includes information about the Indian Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) the endangered Forest Owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti), the Bengal Marsh Mongoose, Snow Leopards and many more. Readers are guided through several chapters each detailing a specific kind of animal, some of them being on the list of endangered species. With over 150 color illustrations, this intriguing reference will be of immense interest to zoologists, ecologists, naturalists and conservation biologists as well as general readers across the world interested in studying such rare or least known animals found in the length and breadth of the Indian region.  p

         	Salim Ali’s fruit bat Latidens salimalii, is endemic to southern India This bat
has long been considered as one of three rarest bats of the world. This is because, until
2000, there were only few individuals caught in mist-nets and the total population is
considered to be less than few hundreds (~ 250) with tiny distribution range. Based on
the above information IUCN has classified this species as “Critically Endangered”. But
recent studies show that the species’ population is between 800-850 individuals (the
estimate is based on the counts in day roosts). Also the distribution and the extent of
occurrence of this bat are getting wider than before as new roosts were being located
particularly in two regions of Western Ghats; 1) High-Wavy Mountains 2) Agasthiyar
Hill Range in Southern India. The day roosts are typically located in high-altitudes, and
are usually closer to the proximity of water source. They rely on wild fruits belong to
the plant spceis like Ficus, Elaeocarpus, Diospyrus, Prunus, Syzygium and Palaquium
in both regions. Currently the bat species face fewer threats; a) anthropogenic activities
to some roosts might disturb their colony, b) roosts located in private estates may face
habitat alterations. Thus, habitat modeling studies (using advanced tools like GIS)
would better depict the long term threats to this species. But the IUCN has to re-review
the current status (i.e., Critically Endangered) of L. salimalii.
