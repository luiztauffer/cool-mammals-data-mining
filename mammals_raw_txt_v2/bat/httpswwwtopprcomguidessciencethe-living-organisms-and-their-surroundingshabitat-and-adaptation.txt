 p Tomorrow you if we go deep down the earth, do you think we’ll find life there? The answer to this is an absolute YES! We can find everywhere, although the question is then why can’t we find polar bears here? Well, we can’t find every organism everywhere. Every organism has its own habitat and they adapt accordingly. Let us know more about habitat and adaptation.  p 
 p    p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Every organism has a unique ecosystem for its habitat. This ecosystem is its natural habitat. This is where the organism meets its basic need for its survival: food, water, shelter from the weather and place to breed its younglings.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The geographical feature and environment conditions on earth differ from one place to another. Some areas of the earth are mountains while others are covered by water. We also find snow, desert, forest, grassland, pond, rivers and lakes. There are many organisms that live in extreme environmental conditions.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  Forest is a large area covered with plants. Forest covers about one-third of our planet. Most of the different types of plants and animals have their forest as their habitat.   span  span style="color: #000000;" Forest broadly divides into three types:   span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" These are found between the equator and two tropics, that is, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn. The Temperature of these forests ranges from 20 to 34 degree Celsius. These regions receive heavy rainfall throughout the year with annual rainfall of more than 200cm. These are spread in India, Malaysia and other countries of South East Asia and South America.  span   p

 p  span style="color: #000000;" Temperate forests are found in eastern North America, northeast Asia and western and central Europe. The temperature of these regions from ranges -30 to 30 Degree Celsius. The annual rainfall is about 150 cm. Temperate forests have well-defined winter and summer seasons.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" These forests are found in Canada, Russia, Scandinavia, China, Mongolia, and north Japan. Here, temperature dips from as low as -50degree Celsius to as high as 30 degree Celsius.  span   p

 p  span style="color: #000000;" Grassland is regions dominated by grasses. There are too many trees and shrubs here. Temperature ranges between-20 degree and -30 degree. The annual rainfall varies between 50 cm and 90 cm.  Some animals commonly in this habitat are giraffe, deer, zebra, lion, elephant, etc.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Deserts are areas that receive very little rainfall less than 25 cm annually. In hot desert, daytime temperature in summer can reach 45 degree Celsius. Organisms such as cactus, camel, gila monster and kangaroo rat are found here.  span   p
