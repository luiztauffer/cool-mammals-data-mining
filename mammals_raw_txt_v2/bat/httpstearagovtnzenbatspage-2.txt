 p New Zealand’s two native bat species are the lesser
      short-tailed bat and long-tailed bat.  p 
 p Lesser short-tailed bats ( em Mystacina tuberculata  em )
      are stocky little animals with pale grey-brown fur, long
      pointed ears and a stumpy tail. They are the only surviving
      members of the Mystacinidae family of bats.  p 
 p Scientists once considered short-tailed bats to be one of
      New Zealand’s ancient animal species. DNA evidence now
      suggests they are more recent arrivals. Species like the
      tuatara and peripatus have been present since the breakaway
      of New Zealand from Gondwana 85 million years ago. But
      Mystacinidae fossils occur in Australia, and it is likely
      that the ancestors of New Zealand’s short-tailed bats crossed
      the Tasman Sea from Australia between 16 and 28 million years
      ago.  p 
 p Once they arrived in New Zealand, lesser short-tailed bats
      continued to evolve. They developed characteristics not found
      anywhere else in the world and have become a biological
      oddity. They are the only bat species that forages for food
      on the ground, like small rodents. Several adaptations make
      this possible: their robust hind legs have small claws, and
      their wings fold down completely and can be tucked away under
      side flaps of thicker skin. This allows the bat to use the
      elbow part of the wings as front legs.  p 
 p Colonies of wingless batfly ( em Mystacinobia
        zelandica  em ) live alongside short-tailed bats. Adult
        batflies and their maggots feed on bat guano (manure). When
        bats leave one roosting site for another there are usually
        a number of batflies clinging to their fur. By hitching a
        ride, the insects can set up colonies in new bat
        roosts.  p 
 p Short-tailed bats are the only species of small bat which
      carry out lek mating (where males assemble in a special area
      and compete for the attention of females). During late
      summer, male short-tailed bats gather at strategic trees near
      communal roosts and attempt to attract females with prolonged
      singing bouts.  p 
 p Lesser short-tailed bats feed on almost anything,
      including insects, fruit, pollen, seeds and nectar. They
      often scurry around on the ground like small mice, fossicking
      under leaf litter in search of bugs. They rely on sound and
      smell to locate food on the ground, but use echolocation to
      catch flying prey. They do not usually fly until well after
      dusk, and typically stay within 10 metres of the ground.  p 
 p Long-tailed bats ( em Chalinolobus tuberculatus  em ) are
      more delicate than the robust short-tailed bats. They have
      chocolate-brown fur, short ears, and a tail that is enclosed
      within a membrane stretched between their legs.  p 
 p They belong to a genus of bats found commonly in
      Australia, Norfolk Island, New Guinea and New Caledonia.
      Ancestors of long-tailed bats were probably wind-blown across
      the Tasman Sea relatively recently (within the last 2 million
      years).  p 
 p Although they are more common than short-tailed bats,
      long-tailed bats are seldom seen. They emerge from their
      roosts around dusk and fly off to hunt. They feed exclusively
      on flying insects.  p 
 p Long-tailed bats form complex social groups. Research on
      radio-tagged bats in Fiordland’s Eglinton Valley has shown
      that the bats frequently switch between roosting alone and
      roosting with a colony, often staying only one night at the
      same place.  p
