 p class="page-heading page-heading--alt" Bat habitats  p 
 p Bats use a variety of landscapes or habitats throughout the year as they feed, roost and travel. They use hunting grounds or foraging habitats to find food and commuting habitats to travel between roosts and foraging habitats. These habitats are vital for bats, which is why the Bat Conservation Trust is working to make more of the landscape bat friendly. For example, we help people create bat friendly gardens, monitor threats to roosts and habitats, present awards for conservation research and contribute to discussions about bats, landscapes and biodiversity.  p
