 p This is a guide to finding tree-roosts. It is the result of the collaborative efforts of professional surveyors and amateur naturalists across Europe as part of the  em Bat Tree Habitat Key  em  project, and represents a combination of firsts:  p 
 p It is the first time legislation and planning policy have been reviewed and put to practical use to define an analysis framework with clearly identifiable thresholds for action. Yet, despite its efficacy in a professional context, it is also the first time a guide has been produced that is equally effective in achieving its objective for amateurs.  p 
 p It is the first time such a method has been evidence-supported throughout, with summary reviews of each aspect of the roosting ecology of the individual 14 tree-roosting species, with illustrative photographs and data to which the reader has open access.  p 
 p It is the first time a repeatable analysis framework has been defined against which the surveyor may compare their results at every stage, from the desk-study, through ground-truthing, survey and analysis, thereby ensuring nothing is overlooked and that every result can be objectively compared. The survey and analysis framework itself is ground-breaking in that it may readily be adapted for any taxa; from moths, through amphibians, reptiles, birds and all other mammals.  p 
 p Used diligently, these methods will reward disproportionately and imbue the reader with renewed confidence as they quickly progress from beginner to competency. Thus, this book is for everyone who has ever wanted to find a tree-roost, or to safeguard against inadvertently damaging one.  p 
 p This book is aimed at tree-care professionals and ecologists, but will also be of use to amateur naturalists.  p

 p  em Bat Tree Habitat Key  em  is an entirely altruistic collaborative project, set up by Henry Andrews, that has been running since 2010. The project objective is to provide an identical detailed account of how each bat species exploits trees as roost sites. This is achieved by data review, collection and analysis within a standardised format, as well as the collection of photographic accounts, which may be contributed by anyone, and are made publicly available for everyone (see www.battreehabitatkey.co.uk and an associated Facebook page). Regardless of political upheaval, the egalitarian nature of  em Bat Tree Habitat Key  em  combined with the active encouragement of criticism, continues to foster a sense of camaraderie between naturalists of all levels and walks of life across Europe, and the wider world.  p
