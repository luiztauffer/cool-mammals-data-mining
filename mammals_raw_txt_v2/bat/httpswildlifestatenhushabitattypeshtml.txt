 p The New Hampshire landscape is rich with habitats for fish and wildlife -- from granite peaks, forests, and wetlands to grasslands, coastal islands, and nearly a thousand lakes and ponds. Twenty-seven habitats are identified in NH’s Wildlife Action Plan -- some of them common and some extremely rare.  a href=".. maps wap.html" Most are mapped in GIS  a  so they can be used to plan and prioritize habitat protection, restoration, or research.  p 
 p    p 
 p New Hampshire is home to more than 500 different wildlife species. The Wildlife Action Plan identifies 169 of these as a ‘Species of Greatest Conservation Need.’ In the charts below you can find information about New Hampshire’s habitat types, the wildlife species that can be found there, and helpful links to learn more. Please note that these are just brief summaries; complete descriptions of habitats, their components, wildlife species and the justification for their conservation, data sources and citations can be found in Appendices A and B of the Wildlife Action Plan.   p

 p Recent forest inventory data suggest that age structure of spruce and   fir trees is heavily unbalanced, with 71% of them in the 2-inch diameter   class because of intensive forestry practices. Photo credit: Ben Kimball, NH   Natural Heritage Bureau  p 
 p Lowland spruce-fir forests occur between 1,000 and 2,500 feet in   elevation and are comprised of a mosaic of lowland spruce-fir forest and   red spruce swamp communities. Typical vegetation includes red spruce,   balsam fir, hobblebush, and bunchberry. Although lowland spruce-fir   covers approximately 10% of the state, it provides habitat for over 100   vertebrate species from spruce grouse to black bear to hoary bats.   Lowland spruce-fir forests also contain very important deer wintering   areas. During heavy snow years, these forests provide an area for   white-tailed deer to yard up where the conifer trees provide food and   shelter from the heavy snow. The federally threatened and state   endangered Canada lynx uses this habitat as well as two state threatened   wildlife species: American three-toed woodpecker and American marten.   In some areas, forest harvesting in this habitat has resulted in trees   that are less than 2 inches in diameter. In other areas, cutting has   converted the landscape to northern hardwood conifer forest. Some   conservation strategies for lowland spruce-fir forests are to protect   unfragmented blocks of land and to maintain late successional habitat.   p

 p This habitat type is typically found between 1,400 and 2,500 feet in   elevation and is usually made up of hardwood trees such as American   beech, sugar maple, yellow birch, and conifer trees such as eastern   hemlock, white pine, and balsam fir. Most of northern hardwood conifer   habitat occurs in central and northern New Hampshire. This transitional   zone provides habitat for many wildlife species including state   threatened species: bald eagle, who nest and roost near lakes and   rivers, and peregrine falcons who nest on cliffs but hunt over the   forest. Other typical species in this habitat include ruffed grouse,   wood thrush, and northern long-eared bat. Development pressure is heavy   within some parts of this habitat type. Forest harvesting is common in   this habitat and if done sustainably produces the diversity of age   classes and species which is beneficial to wildlife. Forestry also has   increased this type of habitat by converting spruce-fir habitats to the   more economically valuable northern hardwoods. Some conservation   strategies for northern hardwood conifer forests are incorporating the   habitat into local conservation planning, protecting unfragmented blocks   of land, and advocating for the adoption of sustainable forestry.   p

 p Alpine habitat is a rare natural community throughout the Northeast, occurring mostly as isolated "islands" on high peaks.
                                  Photo credit: Ben Kimball, NH Natural Heritage Bureau  p 
 p Alpine habitat occurs above treeline at around 4,900 feet elevation and   is characterized by high winds, precipitation, cloud cover and fog. This   results in low annual temperatures and a short growing season. New   Hampshire is home to many high peaks that have alpine habitat including   the tallest in the Northeast: Mount Washington. Alpine areas support   unique plant communities such as Bigelow's sedge meadows which provide   habitat for site-specific species like the state endangered White   Mountain fritillary and the state threatened White Mountain arctic   butterfly. Many birds can also be found in these habitats, but one in   particular breeds in alpine habitat, the American pipit. It is uncertain   exactly what weather conditions will come with climate change, but it   is certain that these unique communities will not have enough time to   respond to these potential changes. Another less talked about threat to   these habitats are human impacts on recreational hiking trails. These   wind blown environments are holding on in cracks and crevices and any   loss of soil or vegetation can set the clock back hundreds of years.   Hikers are urged to stay on established trails. Some conservation   strategies for alpine habitat are restoring rare plant communities and   educating alpine recreation users about their potential impacts.  p

 p  Caves and mines are distinguished from all other New Hampshire habitats   by being located below ground. Cave and mine habitat does not represent   an ecosystem, but rather an abiotic (non-living) habitat type. Most of   our caves are abandoned mines; these historical locations of New   Hampshire's prospecting era now provide an integral part of wildlife   habitat in the state. Caves and mines are extremely important for six of   New Hampshire's nine bat species, such as the state endangered small   footed bat. They use caves and mines as a place to overwinter. Historic   mining data suggest that there could be additional sites that have not   yet been identified as bat hibernacula. The most challenging issues   facing cave and mine habitat are recreational activities such as   spelunking and geocaching, which significantly disturb the bats,   reducing their energy reserves during hibernation. Another more recent   threat is White Nose Syndrome (WNS) that has recently been affecting   bats in other northeastern states.  a href=".. nongame white-nose-syndrome.html" Learn more about WNS  a .   Two conservation strategies for caves and mines is habitat protection   including gating off some critical bat hibernacula and educating   recreational users of their potential impacts to hibernating bats.  p

 p Rocky ridges and talus slopes are two related but distinct habitats. Talus slopes, comprised of loose or stable boulders and rocks, range from open, lichen covered talus "barrens" to closed-canopy forested talus communities. Rocky ridges generally occur on outcrops and bedrock ridges and summits below the alpine zone. Talus slopes and rocky ridges provide crucial habitat for several rare wildlife species in New Hampshire, including bobcat, state endangered timber rattlesnake and eastern small-footed bats, and state threatened peregrine falcon. Due to the inaccessible nature of talus slopes, human impacts exist primarily on the rocky ridge portion of this habitat, though some trails and other impacts are found on talus. Some conservation strategies for rocky ridges and talus slopes are to limit trails through high risk areas and monitoring indicator species for climate change.  p 
 p    p 
 p Cliffs are steep, rocky outcrops greater than 65° in slope and 3 meters in height. They can be low in elevation within a forest or higher in elevation and completely exposed such as the historic location of The Old Man of the Mountain. Cliffs have sparse vegetation that is typically restricted to cracks and crevices where soil accumulates. Depending on the type of rock that make up the cliff, different types of vegetation will grow there such as sheep laurel on acidic cliffs and bulblet bladder fern on calcareous cliffs. Cliffs are used by several wildlife species including the state threatened peregrine falcon, state endangered timber rattlesnake, bobcat, common raven, and long-tailed shrew. Although often viewed as isolated or inaccessible to people, the popularity of cliffs and cliff tops as recreational destinations for hikers and rock climbers is rapidly increasing. Another threat to the tops of these exposed habitats is energy and communication infrastructure such as cell towers and wind turbines. Some conservation strategies for cliff habitat are educating recreational users, habitat protection, and advising wind energy developers of potentially negative impacts through regulation and policy.  br

 p Grasslands are comprised of grasses, sedges, and wildflowers with little   to no shrubs and trees. The most common grassland habitats are   airports, capped landfills, wet meadows, and agricultural fields such as   hayfields, pastures and fallow fields. Pre-colonial grasslands in New   Hampshire were probably only maintained by beaver and fires started by   lightening and Native Americans. The numerous agricultural lands   maintained by early European settlers provided ideal habitat for some   wildlife species that need grassland habitat. As these agricultural   lands were abandoned, these populations began to decline and are now on   the state endangered list such as the eastern hognose snake, northern   harrier, upland sandpiper and on the state threatened list such as the   grasshopper sparrow. Other species also benefit from these open grass   fields such as wood turtles and numerous species of butterflies.   Development and natural forest succession have reduced grassland habitat   in the state. Grasslands require maintenance and must be mowed to   prevent them from becoming shrublands or forests. Only 8% of NH   grasslands are currently under conservation easements. Reclaiming and   maintaining grasslands are two important conservation strategies for   grassland habitats. Many grassland and potential grassland habitat are   on private land and landowners can help restore and conserve them.  p

 p Pine barrens are among the most imperiled natural communities in the   world and contribute significantly to the biological diversity of the   northeast. They are dominated by pitch pine and scrub oak interspersed   with pockets of grassy openings. The sandy, nutrient poor soils are   typically situated along river banks and bluffs. Pine barrens plants are   in constant flux, maintained by frequent disturbances such as   lightning-caused wildfires, which occur naturally and regularly. These   communities support a suite of regionally and globally rare species   including the federally and state endangered Karner blue butterfly, and   other state endangered species such as the frosted elfin butterfly,   persius duskywing and common nighthawk. Other more common species can be   found in pine barrens including white-tailed deer, turkey, and eastern   towhee. Development, fragmentation, and altered natural disturbance   regime threaten this habitat. Without disturbance, pine barrens will   natural succeed to a more diverse forest type, therefore, habitat   management and restoration, particularly using prescribed fire, are two   of the conservation strategies for Pine Barrens.  p 
 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: NHFG  p 
 p Shrubland habitats are shrub-dominated areas with scattered forbs and   grasses. These habitats are typically the result of some disturbance and   include dry shrublands, utility rights-of-way, old agriculture fields,   and reverting gravel pits. Shrublands and other woody early-successional   habitats are declining in New Hampshire and throughout the Northeast as   are the associated wildlife species. Patch size is a key component of   shrublands as wildlife habitats. For example, Golden-winged warblers   occupy patches that are at least 10 hectares, whereas state endangered   New England cottontails occupy patches in southeastern New Hampshire   ranging from 0.2 to 15 hectares. Vegetation structure is also very   important to shrubland habitat as some species require thick understory   such as the New England cottontail and other species require dense   canopy cover in addition to the shrub cover like the American woodcock.   Some of the other species that can be found in shrublands include ruffed   grouse, smooth green snake, wood turtle and the state threatened black   racer. If left alone, many shrublands will naturally succeed into   forests and therefore, natural disturbances or specific management   practices should be allowed to occur to sustain this habitat.   Additionally, habitat fragmentation and habitat loss due to development   threatens shrubland habitats. Some conservation strategies for   shrublands include habitat restoration and management.  p

 p Floodplain habitats occur in valleys adjacent to river channels and are   prone to periodic flooding. Also referred to as riparian forests, they   support diverse natural communities, protect and enhance water quality   by filtering and sequestering pollution, and control erosion and   sediment. Many wildlife species use these forests at some point in their   life cycle. It would not be uncommon to find red-shouldered hawks,   veery, or chestnut-sided warblers breeding in floodplain forests.   Evidence of beaver, mink, or otter can usually be found along the   water’s edge. Other wetland types, like shrub swamps and vernal pools,   can be found within floodplain forests, and these areas are particularly   important for Jefferson salamanders, northern leopard frog, wood   turtles, and state-endangered Blanding's turtles. Since these species,   like most wildlife species, use a variety of habitats, uplands adjacent   to floodplain forests are also crucial for these species. With their   rich soils, floodplains can serve as high quality farmland, and many   floodplains have been converted to agriculture. Other human activities   that have threatened these habitats include residential and commercial   development along rivers, and the installation of dams, which has   altered the natural flooding regime. Floodplain habitats are   particularly vulnerable to invasive plants because the frequent   disturbances from flooding give non-native species opportunities to   establish, and these species tend to thrive in the nutrient rich soils.   Annual flooding can control invasive plants, if the natural flood regime   is not altered. Some conservation actions for maintaining these unique   habitats are managing river impoundments to simulate natural water   flows, removing dams where possible, and protecting the highest quality   sites. Many floodplain forests are on private land and landowners can   help restore and conserve them.  p

 p class="caption-ctr" NH  Natural Heritage Bureau.  p 
 p Emergent marsh and shrub swamp systems have a broad range of flood   regimes, sometimes controlled by the presence or departure of beavers,   but mostly controlled by groundwater. This system, which is an important   food source for many species, is often grouped into three broad habitat   categories: wet meadows, emergent marshes, and scrub-shrub wetlands.   Marsh and shrub wetlands filter pollutants, preventing them from getting   into local streams, and help hold water to reduce flooding. Many   wildlife species use marsh and shrub wetlands including common species   like red-winged blackbirds, beavers, and painted turtles. Marsh and   shrub wetlands are also critically important for state endangered   Blanding's turtles, New England cottontails, northern harriers, ringed   boghaunters, and sedge wrens plus state threatened spotted turtles and   pied billed grebes. Development is a threat to these habitats mostly   from driveways and roads that fragment wetlands or change the flow of   water. The loss of an upland habitat around a marsh or shrub wetland   also increases the amount of pollution and sedimentation threatening the   habitat. Another constant threat to marsh and shrub wetlands is   invasive plants such as purple loosestrife and Japanese knotweed that   compete with native vegetation. Some conservation strategies for marsh   and shrub wetlands are restoration and protection of these important   habitats. Many marsh and shrub wetlands are on private land and   landowners can help restore and conserve them.  p

 p This habitat consists of forested wetlands found mainly in the northern half of the state, including black spruce peat swamps and forest seeps. Black spruce peat swamps are found in central and northern New Hampshire, typically in closed or stagnant basins with limited drainage. These swamps have a forest or woodland structure, but often surround open peatlands. Seeps occur where groundwater emerges at the soil surface and begins flowing into a stream. Despite their small size, they support a distinctive suite of plant species, and have value as wildlife habitat for some amphibians. Between 2004 and 2015, NH DES documented approximately 950 acres of wetlands lost in New Hampshire through development activities. Therefore, development of swamps, surrounding uplands, and impacts from fragmenting features like roads are all threats to this habitat. Other threats include increased temperatures that can cause changes in species composition, and eventual conversion to a different habitat type. The best action we can take to conserve swamps is to delineate forested swamps in northern New Hampshire, and add this information to the review process by the NH DES Wetlands Bureau.   p

 p class="caption-ctr" Many peatland communities are comprised of northern species that barely extend southward into New Hampshire, making them, and the wildlife that depend on them, particularly vulnerable in this state.   p 
 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: Ben Kimball, NH Natural Heritage Bureau  p 
 p Peatland habitats are extremely important for carbon sequestration on a   local and global scale. The water in peatlands has low nutrient content   and typically high acidity caused by limited groundwater input and   surface runoff. These environmental conditions are such that plant and   animal material take a very long time to decompose. This organic   material contains carbon and other nutrients, storing it away and slowly   releasing it into the atmosphere. Drainage and destruction of peatlands   releases this carbon into the atmosphere quicker, increasing greenhouse   gases today. Conservation of the 11 different natural communities that   comprise peatlands is also vital to the continued existence of many rare   plant and wildlife species in New Hampshire. The state endangered   ringed bog haunter uses peatlands and the surrounding uplands in the   southern part of the state. The northern bog lemming inhabits burrows in   the sphagnum moss and associated grasses. Typical vegetation in a   peatland includes sphagnum moss, leather leaf, northern white cedar, and   American larch. Threats to peatland habitats are development, altered   hydrology (amount and flow of water), and unsustainable forest   harvesting. Non-point source pollutants, such as road salt, lawn   fertilizers, and pesticides, also threaten this habitat by altering the   acidity and nutrients. Establishing buffers around this habitat is one   conservation strategy that will help minimize the threats to peatland   habitats.  p 
 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: Ben Kimball, NH Natural Heritage Bureau  p 
 p This habitat consists of forested wetlands found primarily in central and southern New Hampshire. Temperate peat swamps are typically found in isolated or stagnant basins with saturated, organic soils. The temperate swamps classification also includes the four known Atlantic white cedar communities in New Hampshire, and the pitch pine‐heath swamp, a rare community usually associated with the Pine Barrens landscape. Most coastal conifer peat swamps occur within 30 miles of the Atlantic coast. These wetlands provide a number of functions such as flood control, pollutant filters, shoreline stabilization, sediment retention and erosion control, food web productivity, wildlife habitat, recreation, and education. Threats to temperate swamps include habitat degradation from insect pests such as the hemlock woolly adelgid, since hemlock is a common component of temperate swamps across NH. Inputs of sedimentation, insecticides, and fertilizers are sources of pollution that threaten temperate swamp habitats. Actions to conserve temperate swamps include supporting the Division of Forests and Lands in the implementation of the hemlock woolly adelgid action plan, and working with foresters to use Best Management Practices outlined in the document ‘Good Forestry in the Granite State.’  p 
 p align="center" class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: Pete Bowman, Natural Heritage Bureau.   p 
 p Vernal pools are wetland depressions characterized by small size, physical isolation from other wetlands, and periods of flooding and drying. Vernal pools can be found in almost every other habitat type and many wildlife species use them as a place to take a quick drink as they are passing through the area. Some species though are vernal pool-dependant and the loss of this habitat can result in local extinction of these species such as the fairy shrimp, wood frog, spotted salamander, blue-spotted salamander, Jefferson salamander, and the state endangered marbled salamander. The loss of vernal pool habitat due to development is therefore a huge threat, but the surrounding habitat is also just as important as the vernal pool itself.  p 
 p    p 
 p Most of the wildlife species that use vernal pools also spend a great deal of time in the surrounding habitat. Removing the tree canopy around a vernal pool also changes the amount of sunlight reaching the pool and can alter the temperature and the flooding and drying cycle. Some of the conservation strategies for vernal pools include habitat protection and supporting regulations that do not allow dredging and filling of vernal pools. Creating a model for vernal pools is very difficult because they can be found within so many other habitat types and because of the flooding and drying cycle it is not uncommon for vernal pools to be over looked during certain seasons or during drier years. Due to this challenge they were not mapped as part of the Wildlife Action Plan, but you can identify vernal pools on your property.   p

 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: NHFG  p 
 p Coldwater rivers and streams are defined by their ability to maintain cold water temperatures during the hot summer months. The presence of coldwater fish species, including brook trout and slimy sculpin, is often an indicator of coldwater river or stream habitat. Brook trout are rarely found in rivers or streams that exceed a mean temperature of 20°C during the months of July and August. Coldwater rivers and streams are more common in northern New Hampshire and at higher elevations where a cooler local climate causes less warming throughout the summer. In southern New Hampshire and at lower elevations, the presence of coldwater streams depends primarily on the influence of groundwater. Riffles, pools, meander bends, and undercut banks are common habitat features within coldwater rivers and streams, and provide habitat for slimy sculpin, longnose sucker, and burbot. Cold water river and stream habitat is declining as average air temperatures increase with climate change. The increased frequency of intense rainfall events associated with climate change, in these often flashy systems, leads to habitat degradation associated with elevated levels of erosion and sedimentation, especially at the intersection of roads, bridges, and other infrastructure. Actions we can take to protect coldwater rivers and streams include improving habitat connectivity and reducing the impacts of dams on river and stream habitat, and reducing habitat degradation caused by stream crossings. We can preserve the water and habitat quality of rivers, streams and the shorelines of lakes and ponds by preventing development in the riparian zone.  p 
 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: NHFG  p 
 p Lakes and ponds with coldwater habitat include lakes with deep, well oxygenated, cold water that support naturally reproducing populations of coldwater fish species (such as brook trout). This habitat also includes ponds at higher elevations (above 1,900 feet) which maintain cooler water temperatures despite their shallow depth. Although water quality in most lakes and ponds with coldwater habitat is relatively good, high levels of development along the shoreline and in the surrounding watersheds of some lakes may lead to issues, such as eutrophication, in the future. Habitat degradation from undersized stream crossings, pollution from run-off and untreated wastewater, and aquatic herbicide application are threats to this habitat. To conserve lakes and ponds with coldwater habitat, New Hampshire can work on reducing the aquatic habitat impacts associated with artificial water level fluctuation at dams, which can harm aquatic wildlife and plants. Other actions include further surveys to assess the distribution and status of high elevation coldwater pond habitat in New Hampshire, and map the distribution of coldwater fish spawning habitat in deep water lakes.   p 
 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: NHFG  p 
 p Large warmwater rivers are defined as having watersheds greater than 1,000 square miles and an average bankfull width of over 250 feet. In New Hampshire, two rivers have been grouped into this category: the Merrimack River and the Connecticut River, downstream of the confluence with the Upper Ammonoosuc River. Large warmwater rivers alternate between meandering river channels flowing through broad floodplain valleys and more confined sections flowing over boulders and rocky ledges. These rivers support a diverse array of both aquatic and terrestrial species. Large warmwater rivers are important habitat for many diadromous fish species, which migrate in large numbers from the ocean to spawn or live in freshwater. Erosion, ice scour, sediment deposition, and periodic flooding caused by large warmwater rivers create unique habitat features such as floodplain forests, sandy bluffs, and cobble bars. These habitats support a number of species of concern, including the bank swallow and the state-endangered cobblestone tiger beetle. Threats to this habitat type include habitat impacts from fragmentation due to impassable dams, and pollution from run-off, industrial sources, and untreated wastewater. We can help improve the conditions of large warmwater rivers by restoring the natural habitat qualities of a river with practices such as wood additions, bank revegetation, floodplain restoration, or stream channel reconstruction. Another priority should be to construct, maintain, and monitor fishways at dams that currently limit access to suitable freshwater habitat for diadromous fish.  p 
 p align="center" class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: Lindsay Webb, NHFG.   p 
 p Warmwater Lakes and Ponds are defined by their inability to support coldwater fish species due to a lack of cold, well oxygenated water in the summer. Instead, warmwater lakes and ponds typically support warmwater species such as large and smallmouth bass, bluegill, and chain pickerel. These habitats are widespread in New Hampshire and they vary in size, shape, and depth. Waterbodies representative of this category include Pawtuckaway Lake, Pemigewasset Lake, Baboosic Lake, and Country Pond, along with many others. Fishing and wildlife viewing in and around the lakes and ponds is an important contribution to the state's economy. Usually along the shoreline or in shallow areas of the lake, submerged aquatic vegetation provides critical spawning and nursery habitat for a number of fish species. Predators use aquatic vegetation as cover for ambushing prey. Turtles, amphibians, and fish feed on the abundant invertebrate species that are found among aquatic plants. In warmwater lakes and ponds with undeveloped shorelines, waterfowl and many terrestrial species will use the lake or pond as nesting or foraging habitat. One potential threat to this habitat is lake drawdowns and water level management, which can reduce shoreline plant communities and expose aquatic organisms to desiccation during the winter. Pollution from industrial sources, run-off, and untreated wastewater are other major threats to lake and pond ecosystems. Conservation actions for this habitat include protecting important habitat features along shorelines with vegetated buffers;, and working with dam managers to avoid rapid changes in water level, excessive winter drawdown, and reductions in downstream flow.   p 
 p class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: NHFG  p 
 p Warmwater rivers and streams have an average water temperature above 20°C during the months of July and August, which is above the temperature tolerance of brook trout, a coldwater fish species. Warmwater rivers and streams are more common in southern New Hampshire, but they may be found anywhere in the state. Low gradient, slow flowing warmwater rivers and streams often contain submerged aquatic vegetation and share similarities with the shoreline habitat of warmwater lakes and ponds. Faster flowing warmwater rivers and streams may have the appearance of a coldwater stream, but they are home to a different community of fish species, including fallfish, longnose dace, and creek chubs. These habitats are critical for a number of species of conservation concern, including the state-threatened bridle shiner, the banded sunfish, and the state-endangered brook floater mussel. Habitat degradation from stormwater run‐off from impervious surfaces and poorly sized stream crossings are major threats to warmwater rivers and streams. The use of large scale aquatic herbicide applications (usually used to treat invasive plants) was also identified as an emerging threat, since it removes all submerged aquatic vegetation, which is critical habitat to many aquatic species. To conserve these habitats, actions to take include increasing connectivity and reducing habitat degradation caused by stream crossings and dams that block fish passage; and preventing development in the riparian zone.  p

 p class="caption-ctr" Seavey Island provides 99% of the common tern and 100% of the roseate   tern nesting habitat in New Hampshire. Photo credit: NHFG  p 
 p Coastal islands have rocky shores, and are usually remote, undisturbed,   and free of predators. As well as providing critical wildlife habitat,   these islands are host evidence of New Hampshire's rich and vibrant   maritime past. Vegetation on these islands typically includes grasses,   herbaceous plants, and shrub thickets growing among rocky outcrops, with   few to no trees. New Hampshire's Isles of Shoals serve as an important   site for neotropical bird migration and provide wintering habitat for   land birds. Seavey and White Islands provide breeding grounds for   federally endangered roseate terns, state endangered least terns, and   state threatened common terns. In addition to birds, other wildlife   species use these islands such as seals, barnacles, and monarchs. The   most challenging issues facing coastal island habitat and seabird   communities are over-populated introduced predators such as gulls. Other   threats include recreation and climate change. Habitat protection,   controlling overpopulated predators, and preparing for oil spills are a   few of the conservation strategies for coastal islands.  p 
 p align="center" class="caption-ctr" Photo credit: Ben Kimball, NH Natural Heritage Bureau.   p 
 p Coastal sand dunes are constantly changing areas of sand and gravel that   are deposited by wave and wind action within a marine beach system.   This habitat is important to residential and commercial buildings along   the coast because it provides some shelter from storms, wind, waves,   erosion, and rising seal levels. Coastal dunes are considered one of New   Hampshire's most at-risk habitats and are used by many birds for   breeding, migration, or wintering. The federally threatened and state   endangered piping plover uses this habitat for breeding and the   semi-palmated sandpiper and horned lark are two of the many bird species   that use dune habitat during migration. New Hampshire has less than 19   miles of Atlantic coastline, of which less than 2 miles are dune habitat   (the rest being rocky shoreline). Development has reduced the places   where dunes would naturally shift, forcing this habitat to be more   static or to shift into recreational areas. Other threats to this   habitat are oil spills and rising sea level resulting from climate   change. As beach goers this summer we can all help by staying off dune   habitats and obeying restricted area signs and fences. Habitat   protection, education, and enforcing laws and regulations are a few of   the conservation strategies for dunes.  p

 p Estuarine habitats form where rivers meet the sea, in the Great Bay and Coastal watersheds. This includes eelgrass beds, oyster reefs, and intertidal mudflats. Rivers carry nutrients, organic matter, and sediments to estuaries. All of these inputs combine to make estuaries extremely productive habitats with a great abundance of plants and animals. Both the Hampton‐Seabrook and Great Bay estuaries have been designated an Important Bird Area. Species that use estuarine waters for spawning and nursery habitat include smelt, American shad, blueback herring, and horseshoe crabs. The shallow waters of estuaries provide feeding opportunities for osprey and waterfowl. Threats to estuaries include oil spills, problems with excess nitrogen and associated algal blooms, and diseases that impact both the wildlife species and plant communities of estuaries. Actions we can take to conserve estuary habitat include supporting a multi-agency oil spill response plan, and reducing the amount of nitrogen entering estuarine habitat by improving vegetated buffers and upgrading maintenance of septic systems and treatment plants.  p

 p Marine habitats are purely aquatic, in contrast to other coastal habitats such as salt marshes, rocky shores, or dunes. Marine habitat can be generalized to refer to offshore waters including both pelagic and benthic zones as well as the surface of the waters where organisms such as waterfowl may be found. Although State jurisdiction only extends three miles offshore, this delineation has no ecological basis, and marine systems shared by neighboring states are considered in their entirety for the purposes of this habitat category. Coastal migratory fish such as striped bass, mackerel and bluefish frequent nearshore waters. Other important commercially and recreationally harvested species include Atlantic cod, haddock, Pollock and lobsters. Seals and harbor porpoises are common mammals associated with nearshore marine systems in NH. Threats to this habitat include impacts from increasing sea surface temperatures that cause stress for marine life and alterations of marine currents, ocean acidification, and oil spills. Actions to conserve marine habitats include further research into potential shifts in marine food webs in response to ocean acidification, conduct surveys in order to maintain sustainable harvest limits of marine species, and support national standards to reduce mercury and other air pollutants from power plants.  p

 p Salt marshes are grass-dominated tidal wetlands existing in the   transition zone between ocean and upland. They are among the most   productive ecosystems in the world and provide great habitat for many   bird species including American bittern, Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow,   salt marsh sharp-tailed sparrow, seaside sparrow, and semipalmated   sandpiper. Salt marsh plants are salt-tolerant and adapted to   fluctuating water levels. Nutrients that stimulate marsh plant growth   are carried in with the tides, and organic matter that feeds fish and   other organisms is carried out by the tides. Over time, organic matter   accumulates on the marsh and forms peat. By building up more peat, salt   marsh elevation can keep apace with rising sea level, unless the rate of   sea-level rise becomes too great, such as is predicted from climate   change. Salt marshes help protect coastal areas from storm surges, but   an estimated 30-50% of New Hampshire's original salt marsh habitat has   been lost to development. Some of the conservation strategies for salt   marshes are restoring and protecting the remaining salt marsh habitat   and surrounding upland buffer habitat.   p
