 p Bats are an important part of forested ecosystems, deserts, and rangelands and contribute to a
        region’s biodiversity. Bats exist in many different types of habitats like forests, deserts, cities and
        swamp lands. Their habitats need to include dark, protected places to hide from predators, sleep
        during and to hibernate in during the winter.  p 
 p The majority of North American bat species are insectivorous and serve as insect-controllers
        and pollinators. They typically consume more than 50 percent of their body with each night,
        consuming moths, flies, mosquitoes, beetles and other insects. The Brown Bat, one of the most
        common species, can capture 600 mosquitoes in one hour. Nectar-feeding and fruit bats pollinate
        more than 130 types of plants.  p 
 p Forty-five species of bats have been found in the United States and seven of them have been
        listed as threatened or endangered. The decline of bat populations is due to natural factors like
        flooding, freezing and diseases. Human factors, however, are the main cause of their decline.
        These factors include eradication, cave commercialization, deforestation, strip mining and
        improper use of pesticides.  p
