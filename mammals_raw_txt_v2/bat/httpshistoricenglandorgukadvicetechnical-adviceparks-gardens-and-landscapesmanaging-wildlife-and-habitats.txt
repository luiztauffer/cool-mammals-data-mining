 p Most wildlife causes no damage to historic sites and it can be an added attraction.  br  br This page includes advice on wildlife protection, vegetation on walls, bats, birds, squirrels, reptiles, amphibians, insects, peat, and a list of contacts.  br  br Further advice on  a title="Wildlife and habitat conservation - Government website" href="https:  www.gov.uk topic environmental-management wildlife-habitat-conservation%20" wildlife and habitat conservation  a  is provided by Defra.   p

 p 
Many historic property owners and managers may have species, habitats or sites which they are legally required to conserve. If wildlife is damaging historic fabric or archaeology, it is important to prevent or mitigate this without breaking the law. 
  p 
 p 
Owners and managers need to be aware of: 
  p 
 p 
The withdrawal of the UK from the European Union may result in some changes to the Habitats Regulations. Changes will not happen automatically on the date of formal withdrawal but only when (and if) Parliament decides changes are required. 
  p 
 p 
There are four different site designations for wildlife protection. Each of these has a slightly different focus and some sites or parts of a site may be covered by more than one designation. 
  p 
 p 
Walls, and other exposed stonework, are colonised by plants in a similar way to cliffs and scree. These man-made features replace scarce natural habitats. The long association between these plant species and walls is reflected in names such as Wall-flower ( em Erysimum cheiri  em ) or in their scientific names. The Ivy-leaved toadflax’s scientific name is  em Cymbalaria muralis  em . Its species name ‘ em muralis  em ’ means ‘of a wall’. 
  p 
 p 
Control of plant growth on standing historic remains and other walls may be necessary to prevent damage from woody plants, or to clear areas for recording and inspection, or repair work. However, many plants which grow on walls cause no damage, have considerable ecological value and also add to the visual interest of the walls. We recommend that before you carry out any plant growth control work you give careful consideration to whether the wall flora is causing harm. Don't remove vegetation under a presumption that all is harmful or unsightly. Wherever possible, remove vegetation by hand with minimal use of chemicals. 
  p 
 p 
Most flowering plants and ferns can establish in mortar-filled joints in stonework, or take advantage of cracks and crannies in old walls. 
  p 
 p 
Individual species of lichens and mosses like different types of stone and aspects. Variation in construction materials and orientation can produce conditions suitable for several different species. 
  p 
 p 
Building stone that has been brought in from a distance can provide a different growing base for plants to the local stone. For example granite or sandstone brought into a limestone area. 
  p 
 p 
Walls provide demanding conditions for plants because of exposure, drought and sparse amounts of soil development. True wall plants are able to withstand extremes of temperature and drought. These specialised conditions allow uncommon plants to grow which would be displaced by more vigorous, common species on less hostile sites. The mortar is usually more alkaline than the stonework so a wall built of acid stone may still support lime-loving plants. Historic sites are especially important, because the structure and age of their walls provide a range of opportunities for plants such as weathered stonework and lime-rich mortar. 
  p 
 p 
Sometimes wall flora, especially a grassy turf on the top of a ruined wall, can protect the wall from extremes of temperature and heavy rainfall. More stable conditions within a wall will help conserve the wall itself. This turf may be a valuable wildlife habitat for plants and animals. Give careful consideration to the role of wall top vegetation before you take any decision to remove it. Increasingly, soft cappings are being installed onto wall tops to assist their future conservation.

Bats are often found in historic buildings as they provide a large range of potential roosting areas and many entry points. 
  p 
 p 
All bats and their roosts (whether in use or not) are protected by law. You need a  a title="Bats: Potection and licences" href="https:  www.gov.uk guidance bats-protection-surveys-and-licences%20" licence from Natural England  a  for any work that may disturb them or their habitats. Bats use different roosts at different times of the year and with specialist advice it may be possible to avoid disturbance (and the need for a licence) by carrying out work at an appropriate time of year. 
  p 
 p 
More advice on working with bats can be found in our  a title="Bats in Traditional Buildings" href=" images-books publications bats-in-traditional-buildings " data-id="27831" Bats in Traditional Buildings  a  guidance.  br  br The publication covers:

Bats are nocturnal and are rarely seen during the day but they sometimes get into rooms during daylight hours particularly if they are young, or lost, sick or injured, or disorientated. If you do find a bat, follow the advice given by the  a title="Bat Conservation Trust: Need help with a Bat?" href="http:  www.bats.org.uk pages help.html%20" Bat Conservation Trust  a . 
  p 
 p 
Owners or managers of properties which host bats should be aware of the potential risk of  a title="Bat Conservation Trust: Bat rabies" href="http:  www.bats.org.uk pages -bats_and_rabies-1099.html%20" bat rabies  a  and handling bats. These ‘bat rabies’ lyssaviruses are found in bats across Northern Europe and have occasionally been found in bats in the UK.

All wild birds are protected by law. 
  p 
 p 
The  a title="Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981)" href="http:  www.legislation.gov.uk ukpga 1981 69 contents" Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981)  a  Section 1 makes it an offence to kill, injure or take any wild bird; or to take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird while that nest is in use or being built; and to take or destroy an egg of any wild bird. The ‘nesting period’ when nests are being built or in use varies slightly depending on the weather each year but is generally March to August. 
  p 
 p 
Some species of birds, particularly when in large numbers, can cause problems for historic buildings. Preventative measures such as scaring birds away, preventing roosting or preventing access (provided this is outside of the nesting period) do not require permission, although such measures may require  a title="Scheduled Monument Consent" href=" advice planning consents smc " data-id="21606" Scheduled Monument   a or  a title="Listed Building Consent" href=" advice planning consents lbc " data-id="21595" Listed Building Consent  a .  a title="Bird Licences - Government website" href="https:  www.gov.uk government collections bird-licences" Licences  a  will be required for other means of control.

Two species of squirrel are found in England, the endangered native Red Squirrel ( em Sciurus vulgaris  em ) and the common, introduced Grey Squirrel ( em Sciurus carolinensis  em ). Very occasionally albino (white) and melanic (black) forms of either species occur. 
  p 
 p 
Red Squirrels are a protected species under the a title="Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981)" href="http:  www.legislation.gov.uk ukpga 1981 69 contents"  Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981  a . The population has declined considerably in the last century and they are restricted to a few locations in England – principally Northumberland, Cumbria and the Isle of Wight. They are rare and should be safeguarded on sites where they are present; and steps taken to stop Grey Squirrels invading. 
  p 
 p 
Red Squirrels do not pose a threat to trees, plant collections or other wildlife. They are generally extremely shy creatures and are not known to enter buildings or to pose a threat to staff or visitors on sites. 
  p 
 p 
Grey Squirrels are not protected and are common in most areas. They originate from North America. The first recorded introduction was in 1876 (although there are recorded sightings of Grey Squirrels as early as 1828) and this was followed by numerous other releases over the next 50 years. Once it became apparent that this species was spreading unchecked throughout the country a Prohibition Order preventing their import or release, was issued in 1937. 
  p 
 p 
Populations can reach proportions where damage is done to other wildlife, trees, gardens and properties. They will strip bark from trees particularly when their numbers are high. Bark stripping is extremely disfiguring to trees and can be lethal and therefore a serious risk in historic parks, woodlands and tree collections. 
  p 
 p 
Grey Squirrels can also damage other wildlife, particularly birds, stealing both eggs and nestlings. They are much bolder than their red cousins and are often found to enter roof spaces where they will gnaw cables and pipes. In many places they appear tame, but people forget that they are wild animals and over familiarity can result in painful bites or scratches. 
  p 
 p 
In such situations you should take measures to control the squirrel population. It's an offence under the  a title="Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981)" href="http:  www.legislation.gov.uk ukpga 1981 69 contents" Wildlife &amp; Countryside Act 1981  a  to release Grey Squirrels into the wild. This means that squirrels caught in non-lethal traps must be humanely destroyed and cannot be released elsewhere.

The three  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - Native snakes" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org Pages Category snakes%20" native snakes  a  are the Grass snake  em (Natrix natrix  em ), Smooth snake ( em Coronella austriaca  em ) and Adder ( em Vipera berus  em ). The three  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - Native snakes" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org Pages Category lizards" native lizards  a  are the Common lizard  em (Lacerta vivipara  em ), Sand lizard ( em Lacerta agilis  em ), and the Slow worm ( em Anguis fragilis  em ) which looks like a snake but is in fact a legless lizard. 
  p 
 p 
In addition, there are a number of  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - no native reptiles" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org non-native-reptiles" non-native species  a  which have been introduced and have become established in different parts of England. In particular this includes the red-eared terrapin ( em Tracemys scripta elegans  em ) which is particularly devastating to native wildlife. br  br Both the Sand lizard and Smooth snake are also protected by European Directive. Loss of habitat is the main reason for decline so sites which retain features such as moats, ponds, caves, boundary banks, old hedges, meadows, or scrub in their grounds are valuable. Some species may shelter in old walls.  br  br Advice on good management practices can be found in the  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - Habitat Management Handbooks" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org habitat-management-handbooks" Reptile Habitat Management Handbook   a produced by  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org " Amphibian and Reptile Conservation  a .

The four  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - Native frogs and toads" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org Pages Category frogs-and-toads" native frogs and toads  a  are the Common toad ( em Bufo bufo  em ), Natterjack toad ( em Bufo calamita  em ), Common frog ( em Rana temporaria  em ), and the Pool frog ( em Pelophylax lessonae  em ) – previously extinct but recently re-introduced to one site in Norfolk. The three  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - Native newts" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org Pages Category newts" native newts  a  are the Smooth newt ( em Triturus vulgaris  em ), Great crested newt ( em Triturus cristatus  em ) and Palmate newt ( em Triturus helveticus  em ). 
  p 
 p 
There are also a number of  a title="Amphibian and Reptile Conservation - Non native amphibians" href="http:  www.arc-trust.org non" non-native amphibians  a  which have been introduced and have become established in different parts of England, including two newts, two toads, seven frogs and the Fire Salamander ( em Salamandra salamandra  em ). 
  p

There are very few native insects which cause external damage to historic buildings, or to landscapes. 
  p 
 p 
However there are a wide range of  a title="Insect Pests found in Historic Houses and Museums poster" href="http:  www.english-heritage.org.uk content learn conservation 2543455 2543024 insect-pests-poster" insect pests  a  (both native and introduced) which can cause problems to the interiors and contents of historic houses. Our  a title="Practical Building Conservation Series" href=" advice technical-advice buildings practical-building-conservation " data-id="22284" Practical Building Conservation  a  book on timber includes advice and guidance on insect damage. br  br There are 49  a title="JNCC - Invertebrates" href="http:  jncc.defra.gov.uk page-1740%20" protected native invertebrates  a  (47 insects - 25 butterflies, eight moths, eight beetles, one cicada, three crickets, two dragonflies and two spiders, which are arachnids) listed under the  a title="Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981)" href="http:  www.legislation.gov.uk ukpga 1981 69 contents" Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981  a . All of these insects are rare and although some may be found on historic sites they are unlikely to cause damage. 
  p 
 p 
The only native insect species likely to cause damage to the outside of historic structures are Masonry bees. These solitary bees excavate tunnels in which to lay a small number of individual eggs. They usually do this in mortar, but may occasionally excavate soft sandstones or limestones. Damage is usually minimal, although on some occasions large numbers of individuals may use particularly favoured sites and damage may be extensive. There is no restriction on repairing any damage caused. These insects act as individuals and are not aggressive. 
  p 
 p 
Honey bees, Wasps and occasionally Hornets will sometimes use buildings or trees for their nests. Where the entrances to these nests are near to staff or visitor routes safety concerns will arise. All three species, but particularly Honey bees, will aggressively defend their nests and human activity nearby can provoke a response.  br  br Hornet and Wasp queens overwinter as individuals and build a new colony from scratch each year. If nests start to appear in inappropriate places, control at an early stage, before large numbers have been built up is advisable. There are no legal restrictions on control. br  br Honey bees are most likely to appear suddenly in a large swarm, detached from an existing colony, with a queen in the centre. These often rest in a place while scouts look for a suitable new home, so may only stay a few hours. If they find a suitable site and take up permanent residence in a place unsuitable for site safety, removal is the best option. Bee swarms are regularly sought by bee-keepers and most will happily come out to site and expertly remove a swarm for free and the  a title="British Beekeepers Association" href="https:  www.bbka.org.uk help do_you_have_a_swarm.php%20" British Beekeepers Association  a  website has a facility to find local ‘swarm collectors’.
