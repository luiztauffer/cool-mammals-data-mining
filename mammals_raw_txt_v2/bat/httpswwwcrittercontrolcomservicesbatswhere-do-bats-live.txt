 p Bats are found in nearly every geographic region in the world except for those of extreme cold. In the United States, the mammals favor temperate climates. However, they can live wherever a steady supply of food exists. Favorite environments include tropical forests, woodlands, open fields, both suburban and urban communities, and even deserts. Roosting requirements usually depend on the species, but caves, trees, hollowed logs, rock crevices, and human dwellings serve as excellent habitats. br

 p When natural bat habitats overlap with residential areas, conflicts arise. Bats take up residence in barns, sheds, and other outbuildings, as well as in attics. They find their way inside through gaps in roofs or uncovered chimneys. Once bat colonies are established, resulting problems range from general noise and smell nuisances to the heightened risk of contracting illnesses. In order to properly remove bat populations from homes, contact professional wildlife removal specialists.
