 p  Indiana Bats (Myotis sodalis) are small bats that live within colonies ranging from 500 to 5,000 individuals. They like to roost and forage within forested woodlands and wetlands, hibernate in caves, and create maternity sites behind loose tree bark on dead and dying trees. The Indiana Bat is listed as an endangered animal under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The CHCP is being written as a voluntary option for ESA compliance for species like the Indiana Bat.  p
