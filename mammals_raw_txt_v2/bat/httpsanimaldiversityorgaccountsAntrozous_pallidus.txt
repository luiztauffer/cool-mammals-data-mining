They occur from the Okanagan valley in British Columbia, south through eastern Washington, Oregon, and California to Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Queretaro, and Nuevo Leon in Mexico. They are found as far east as western Texas, Oklahoma, southern Kansas, southern Wyoming, and southern Idaho.

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Pallid bats are also called desert bats because they are mostly found in desert habitats. They roost in a variety of places but favor rocky outcrops. They also occur in oak and pine forested areas and open farmland. Roosting sites are variable, depending on what is available. They can be found roosting in caves, rock crevices, mines, hollow trees, and buildings. Pallid bats in Oregon have been documented roosting in rock piles, piles of burlap sacks, and hollow trees. They use day roosts that are semi-dark, as long as there is some sort of cover. Night roosts for resting between feeding intervals are near day roosts, but are not the same as day roosts. Pallid bats prefer darkness, shelter from wind and rain, and an easy escape if they are disturbed. Roosts are usually near a source of water, but this does not appear to be a main requirement for roosting locations. Winter roost locations are not well known for  span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species" A. pallidus  span . Specimens captured in Oregon during the winter were not anywhere near summer roosting sites. Winter specimens were found in narrow crevices; this may contribute to the difficulty of locating these individuals in the winter.
A study done by Vaughan and O’Shea (1976) showed that pallid bats arrive in Arizona sometime around March or April and then depart again in November. They were observed using vertical and overhanging cliff crevices, but during the hottest part of the day they were found to move to deeper, cooler crevices to maintain a more suitable body temperature.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#885d53a5999cc9463f14ff8b7e65f7a6" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a ;  a href="#4cbd4329e0efd419b3166be5a40d86bc" class="citation" Vaughan and O’ Shea, 1967  a ;  a href="#71fa141a3a6c875677c70b15bcc17eb5" class="citation" Verts and Carraway, 1998  a )  span   p

Forearm length is 45 to 60 mm long and body weight ranges from 17 to 28 grams. Their fur has a woolly feel with a cream-yellow to light brown color on the dorsum and very pale to white color on the venter. This species has a U-shaped ridge on the top of the muzzle with the nostrils located underneath the ridge on the front of its muzzle. The face has small wart-like pararhinal glands that produce a skunk-like odor, which is thought to be used as defense mechanism. The ears are large with a long, pointed tragus; the tragus is half as long as the ear itself. Their ears have serrated outer edges that are not joined at the base. They have a high brain case with a rostrum that is greater than the half the length of the skull and have a dental formula: I 1 2, C 1 1, P 1 2, M 3 3, with a total of 28 teeth.

Males are present in nursery colonies as well as in separate single-sex groups. Breeding takes place in early October and continues sporadically throughout the winter. Bats in captivity mate in October and November, some have been observed mating in January and February. In captivity, mated females ovulate and become pregnant with an increase in ambient temperature.

The gestation period lasts from 53 to 71 days and young are born between May and June. They usually have twins, but about 20 percent of births are single. Birth weight is near 3 grams. The young open their eyes about five days after their birth and begin to fly at 4 to 5 weeks after birth. At 6 to 8 weeks after birth they are weaned and are able to breed in their first year.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#71fa141a3a6c875677c70b15bcc17eb5" class="citation" Verts and Carraway, 1998  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" The young are born in an altricial state. They have closed eyes and their ears are folded against the head with a few hairs visible only under magnification. The mothers will carry the young during her foraging flights for the first few days after birth. Females only lactate for 2 to 3 months and do not nurse young that are not their own. The young have recurved cusps on their deciduous teeth. This allows the young to grasp the nipple of the females in order to prevent detatchment in flight.
Mothers will stay with their young for 12 months after the young are flying on their own. This is also when most will fly in family groups of two or three when returning to their day roost. The day roosts may not always be the same place, allowing the young bats to learn how to seek out the vocal calls when the colony swarms around the chosen day roost sight. Males do not care for offspring.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#885d53a5999cc9463f14ff8b7e65f7a6" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Pallid bats are highly social. A single colony can range from 12 to 100 bats. About 95% of groups consist of at least 20 individuals, with the largest colony consisting of 162 bats. Pallid bats stay in their roosts longer into the evening before emerging to hunt than other species of bats. Time of emergence will change with season. During summer males and females can be found roosting together or in single-sex colonies. Males won’t usually join roosts of females with young until the young have begun foraging on their own.
Pallid bats are very good at climbing and crawling, but are slower flyers with little maneuverability when compared to smaller bats. Pallid bats are agile when crawling, allowing them to move efficiently on the ground. 
When returning to their day roosts, pallid bats swarm and vocalize around the entrance for 15 to 45 minutes, calling individuals back to the roost. This swarm will evaluate the entrance until one bat enters and calls the rest into the roost. When they settle in summer day roosts they maintain a body temperature of around 30° C. When in torpor they may move to a cooler place in the roost in order to maintain that body temperature. During rest intervals in night roosts, pallid bats will also enter torpor for 2 to 5 hours, depending on the season. Pallid bats do not migrate, except for short distances to winter hibernacula.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#885d53a5999cc9463f14ff8b7e65f7a6" class="citation" Nowak, 1999  a ;  a href="#71fa141a3a6c875677c70b15bcc17eb5" class="citation" Verts and Carraway, 1998  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Pallid bats have a unique foraging pattern among North American bats. They fly low to the ground (about 15 to 76 centimeters), then dip and rise in swoops in order to grab ground-dwelling prey or slow-flying prey. This pattern allows them to use passive hearing to hear their prey on the ground. They may drop to the ground to grab large, ground-dwelling prey. They also forage for insects among leaves and flowers. They will take smaller prey in the air using echolocation. Pallid bats take larger prey back to their roosts and remove hard parts, such as wings, legs, and heads, from  prey before eating them.
Pallid bats have two nightly foraging periods with a roosting time in between. They prey mainly on large flying and ground-dwelling insects, including beetles ( a class="taxon-link rank-order" href=" accounts Coleoptera " Coleoptera  a ), crickets, katydids, and grasshoppers ( a class="taxon-link rank-order" href=" accounts Orthoptera " Orthoptera  a , including Jerusalem crickets  a class="taxon-link rank-species" href=" accounts Stenopelmatus_fuscus " Stenopelmatus fuscus  a ), cicadas ( span class="taxon-name" Homoptera  span ), moths ( a class="taxon-link rank-order" href=" accounts Lepidoptera " Lepidoptera  a ), spiders ( a class="taxon-link rank-order" href=" accounts Araneae " Araneae  a ), scorpions ( span class="taxon-name" Scorpiones  span ), centipedes ( a class="taxon-link rank-class" href=" accounts Chilopoda " Chilopoda  a ).

The fungus, Geomyces destructans, grows best in cold, humid conditions that are typical of many bat hibernacula. The fungus grows on, and in some cases invades, the bodies of hibernating bats and seems to result in disturbance from hibernation, causing a debilitating loss of important metabolic resources and mass deaths. Mortality rates at some hibernation sites have been as high as 90%.
