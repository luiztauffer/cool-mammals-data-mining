 p During late spring in the  Sonoran Desert, the white flowers of Saguaro ( em Carnegiea gigantea  em ) cacti bloom for just one evening to  attract Lesser Long-nosed Bats ( em Leptonycteris curasoae yerbabuena)   em and  Mexican Long-tongued Bats ( em Choeronycteris  mexicana  em ) for pollination. The  bats use their elongated muzzles to reach deep into Saguaro blossoms for  nectar, covering their hairy heads with copious amounts of pollen that drop  onto other flowers as the bats fly from cactus to cactus throughout the night. The blossoms close by the following afternoon,  allowing daytime visitors such as wasps, bees, butterflies, and birds to pick  up any remaining nectar or pollen left behind.  p 
 p Lesser long-nosed bats are perfectly adapted to feed and pollinate Saguaros and other large  Southwestern and Mexican succulents such as Organ-pipe Cactus ( em Stenocereus thurberi  em ), agaves ( em Agave   em spp.) and Card√≥n ( em Pachycereus pringlei  em ). Their narrow snouts easily detect the strong  melon scent of the night-blooming flowers, and their brush-tipped tongues extend  deeply into flowers to extract rich quantities of nectar and pollen produced by  the cacti to ensure that pollinators will find them during their brief period  of bloom.  p 
 p Bat  pollination of cacti and agaves helps maintain healthy desert ecosystems. Saguaros, the state flower of Arizona, are  keystone species in the Sonoran Desert and grow up to 50 feet in height, providing  important perching and nesting sites for Red-tailed Hawks ( em Buteo jamaicensis  em );  and nesting cavities for Gilded Flickers ( em Colaptes  chrysoides  em ) and Gila Woodpeckers ( em Melanerpes uropygialis  em ), Elf Owls ( em Micrathene whitneyi  em ), Purple Martins ( em Progne subis  em ), and other birds. Once the Saguaro fruit ripens in June, Lesser  Long-nosed Bats, White-winged Doves ( em Zenaida  asiatica  em ), Gila Woodpeckers, and other birds consume the fleshy red  pulp and thereby disperse the seeds, which pass through their guts intact. Agaves provide an important food resource to  the Lesser Long-nosed Bat during its annual migration from Mexico to the Sonoran Desert.  p 
 p The  Lesser Long-nosed Bat is  federally listed as endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  The survival of both bats and their desert food plants are threatened by  loss of habitat due to development, invasive annual grasses, and changes in  fire regimes. With nature in the  balance, ensuring the future of the southwestern desert will depend on appreciating  and protecting the roles played by both pollinator and plant in these fragile  ecosystems.  p
