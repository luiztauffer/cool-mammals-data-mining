Bats produce high-frequency sound waves using their nose or mouth.  When the sound hits an object an echo bounces back to the bat's large funnel-shaped ears.  
The bat can instantly identify an object by the sound of the echo. Bats can even tell the size, shape and texture of  
a tiny insect from the echo.  Most bats use echolocation to navigate in the dark and hunt for food.
