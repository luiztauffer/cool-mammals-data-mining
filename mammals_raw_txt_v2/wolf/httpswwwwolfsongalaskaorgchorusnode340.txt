 p Since November 1988 Wolf Song of Alaska has distinguished itself as a highly visible and internationally respected organization. We are committed to an understanding of the wolf, its natural history, its varied relation to humans throughout the ages, and its role as a major symbol in folklore, myth, legend, art and religion, through education, science and public awareness. Established in 1988, we are an IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-political volunteer organization. Federal ID #92-0127397 -  a href="mailto:wolfsong@wildwolves.org" wolfsong@wildwolves.org  a   p
