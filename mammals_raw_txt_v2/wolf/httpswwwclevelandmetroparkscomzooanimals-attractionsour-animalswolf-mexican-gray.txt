The Zoo is tackling today's most complex and pressing human-wildlife conservation issues with conservation partnersÂ in more than a dozen countries around the world.  p 
 p class="medium-small-summary-text" After almost going extinct in its native range, this rare, genetically distinct subspecies was re-introduced in 1998. Now there are estimated to be 40-50 individuals in the wild in Arizona and New Mexico.  p 
 p Similar to other species of gray wolf. Lives in packs and communicates with scent marking, body posturing, and vocalizations such as howling.  p 
 p Both male and female take part in raising the young. Pups are born blind and deaf; weighing approximately 450g (1 lb) they gain as much as 3 lbs per week for the first 14 weeks. After 11 days, the eyes open and are blue in color until they become gold between 8-16 weeks. Teeth begin to erupt at 15 days and the young receive meat regurgitated by adults, weaned by 8-10 weeks of age. Body and coat begins to resemble an adult's at around 4 weeks old, sexual maturity occurs by 22 months.  p
