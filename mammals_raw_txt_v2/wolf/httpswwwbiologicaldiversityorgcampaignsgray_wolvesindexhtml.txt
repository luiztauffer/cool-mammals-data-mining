 p Few  animals evoke the wild like wolves: Majestic, rangy and highly social, they’re crucial  in driving evolution and balancing ecosystems. Wolves once roamed freely  throughout North America, in numbers estimated at some 2 million. But federal  extermination programs and conflicts with human settlements have reduced their  numbers to the breaking point. br 
             br 
            By the 1960s gray wolves were finally protected under what would become the  Endangered Species Act. They had been exterminated from all the contiguous  United States except a portion of Minnesota and Isle Royale National Park in  Michigan.          p

 p After receiving federal  protection, gray wolves saw tremendous recovery in the western Great Lakes  region. Their populations grew to around 4,500 and expanded through Wisconsin  and Michigan. Through natural migration from Canada and reintroduction to  Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho, wolves returned to the  a href="https:  www.biologicaldiversity.org species mammals northern_Rocky_Mountains_gray_wolf index.html" northern Rockies  a  and are  establishing a toehold in the  a href="http:  www.biologicaldiversity.org campaigns wolves_on_the_west_coast index.html" West Coast states  a  a href="https:  www.biologicaldiversity.org species mammals northern_Rocky_Mountains_gray_wolf index.html" .   a There are now  about 1,700 wolves across Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Washington and Oregon, with  a few wolves beginning to range into California. In the Southwest Mexican gray  wolves also saw recovery — but to a lesser degree. Just seven surviving  a href="https:  www.biologicaldiversity.org species mammals Mexican_gray_wolf index.html" Mexican gray wolves  a  were captured  between 1977 and 1980 and bred in captivity. After their progeny were  reintroduced into Arizona and New Mexico, Mexican gray wolves now number 110 in  the U.S. wild, but fewer than 20 remain in Mexico. br 
             br 
        Despite these substantial gains, the job of wolf recovery is far from over.  Wolves need connected populations for genetic sustainability, and natural  ecosystems need wolves to maintain a healthy balance of species — yet today  wolves occupy less than 10 percent of their historic range and continue to face  persecution. The Center has worked to save wolves since our inception, and we  continue to defend them through science, the law and with our supporters’ help.  p 
 p    p 
 p     p 
 p Beginning in 2003 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began  moving to reduce or remove protections for wolves, but was repeatedly rebuffed  by the courts. In 2009 the agency published separate rules removing protections  in the northern Rockies and western Great Lakes, allowing wolf-hunting to move  forward in both regions and spurring a court battle.   p 
 p In the northern Rockies, the Center and allies  successfully restored protections through a court victory, but in April 2011  Congress attached a rider to a must-pass budget bill that stripped Endangered  Species Act protections from wolves in all of Montana and Idaho, the eastern  third of Washington and Oregon, and a small portion of northern Utah — an  unprecedented action that, for the first time in the history of the Act,  removed a species from the endangered list by political fiat instead of  science. Wolves remained protected in Wyoming, but in September 2012 the Fish  and Wildlife Service again moved to delist them.   p 
 p The 2009 rule removing protections in the Great Lakes states  of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and portions of South Dakota and North  Dakota, Iowa, Indiana and Illinois was likewise quickly overturned in the  courts, but Fish and Wildlife came back in 2011 and again removed protections  in the region.   p 
 p With protections removed in the two regions where  wolves actually occurred, the Obama administration issued a proposal in 2013 to  strip Endangered Species Act protections from gray wolves across the  rest of the lower 48 states outside the Southwest, where the Mexican gray wolf  was struggling to survive. The proposal asserts that wolf protection in place in  the continental United States since 1978 is no longer needed.   p 
 p In September and December 2014, two federal court  rulings prompted by lawsuits filed by the Center and other allies restored federal  protections to wolves in Wyoming and in the western Great Lakes states, with  the judges in each case finding that in stripping protections for wolves the  Fish and Wildlife Service violated the Endangered Species Act. This in turn has  stalled the administration's plans to remove protections across the lower 48,  and today wolves remain protected everywhere except those areas in the northern  Rockies where Congress' disastrous rider removed them.    p 
 p Unfortunately, Congressional Republicans are again  attempting to meddle in what should be scientific decisions and have introduced  multiple riders to various budget bills to again strip wolves of protection in  Wyoming and the Great Lakes. And the Trump administration is planing a proposal to strip  wolves of federal protections nearly everywhere else in the country is still  pending. The Center is continuing to work with allies on Capitol Hill to halt any wolf-delisting riders on any  budget bill. br 
  p 
 p Since the Center's inception, we have campaigned for  wolves, adapting our efforts as the opportunities for recovery changed. We have  taken the long view, even while addressing short-term threats.   br 
             br 
            Our 1990 lawsuit, with allies, to compel reintroduction of the Mexican gray  wolf led to a 1993 settlement agreement that resulted in the 1998  reintroduction of the wolves into the Apache and Gila national forests. The Center,  founded in the Gila in 1989 and maintaining staff in the reintroduction area to  the present day, monitors wolf and habitat management. We have vigorously  challenged federal shooting and trapping of Mexican wolves and are pushing for  the resumption of wolf releases from captivity to the wild. We've petitioned  and sued for changes in wolf management, development of a new, science-based  Mexican wolf recovery plan, and listing of the Mexican wolf as an endangered  subspecies or population of the gray wolf to afford it the right to such a  plan. We help organize public pressure on agencies and elected officials to  provide maximum protection for the beleaguered Mexican wolves. We currently  have two active lawsuits filed against the Fish and Wildlife Service. br 
             br 
            In the northern Rocky Mountains, the Center was part of four successful lawsuits  that delayed the removal of federal protections for wolves from April 2003,  when first promulgated by the Bush administration, until May 2011, when  protections were finally (though still prematurely) removed through the  infamous congressional rider. Our legal efforts helped to allow the wolf  population to grow by 1,000 animals during those eight years, from 761 to  1,774. The Center mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge in district and  appeals courts to the constitutionality of the rider. Since then we have helped  publicize the slaughter of northern Rockies wolves, as part of a long-term  strategy to pressure Congress to rescind the harmful rider, and filed a lawsuit  that was successful in restoring “endangered” protections to wolves in Wyoming,  where the 2011 rider does not apply. br 
             br 
            We have also stood up for protection of the growing but still vulnerable  population of wolves in Washington, Oregon and California. In 2006, with all  these wolves still protected as endangered, we successfully opposed issuance of  a permit to allow killing wolves in Oregon on behalf of the livestock industry.  After the 2011 delisting of most wolves in the state, the Center and allies  successfully sued under state law to save the lives of two wolves that Oregon  officials had ordered killed. In 2012 we helped kill an Oregon bill that would  have overturned our success in court and allowed the wolves' destruction. We  also filed a scientific petition with California officials to place wolves on  the state's endangered list and prepare a recovery plan — and in early June  2014 the California Fish and Game Commission voted to protect wolves under  the state Endangered Species Act, just hours after scientists confirmed that  OR-7 — the wolf that wandered into California in late 2011 and returned  periodically — had sired pups in southern Oregon. California is now home to its  first confirmed family of wolves in nearly 100 years: a   a  The  Shasta pack, so named because this wolf family was identified and confirmed in  August 2015 to be establishing territory in Siskiyou County, home to majestic  Mount Shasta. Because of the Center's successful state-listing petition, the  Shasta pack and any other wolves that disperse to California are now fully  protected under state law, and harming, harassing or killing a wolf in  California for any reason other than in defense of human life is illegal. br 
             br 
            In the Midwest, as in the northern Rockies, multiple lawsuits filed by the  Center and allies helped delay removal or reduction of protections, allowing  continued growth in the wolf population. In 2012 we filed a challenge to  Minnesota's first-ever regulated wolf-hunting season. In a groundbreaking  victory for Great Lakes wolves, they were again granted Endangered Species Act  protection in late 2014, after a federal court ruled in a case brought by one  of our partners showing that prematurely stripping wolves of protection  violated the Endangered Species Act.

        Since the original wolf recovery plans were written in the 1980s, we've learned  much more about wolves' behavior, ecology and needs. We know, for example, that  returning wolves to ecosystems sets off a chain of events that benefits many  species, including songbirds and beavers that gain from a return of streamside  vegetation — which thrives in the absence of browsing elk that must move more  often to avoid wolves — and pronghorn and foxes that are aided by wolves'  control of coyote populations.   p
