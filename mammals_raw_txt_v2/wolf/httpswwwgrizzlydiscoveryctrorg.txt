 p We had a great experience looking at grizzly bears and wolves, up close and personal. The Center saves these animals and educates the public about these special members of our environment. It is a good value because you get two days for the price of one. I fully recommend this side trip to Yellowstone. Take your camera!!! Great for all age groups.
