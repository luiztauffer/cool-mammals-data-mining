On March 15, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) officially proposed removing federal Endangered Species Act protections for gray wolves across the entire lower 48 states, a plan that would put the future of the gray wolf and its proven benefits to ecosystems at serious risk.  p 
 p The proposed rule removes federal Endangered Species Act protections for all gray wolves in the contiguous United States except for the population of critically endangered Mexican gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico, where only about 114 remain.  p 
 p The most effective way to show opposition to USFWS’s delisting proposal is to write personalized comments on the proposed rule in the Federal Register.  p 
 p Open the suggested  a href="https:  nywolf.org about-us talking-points-to-guide-your-words" target="_blank"  strong talking points here  strong   a  to guide your words.  p 
 p The 60-day public comment period remains open through May 14, 2019.  p

 p The study tested the extent to which dogs and grey wolves collaborate with humans in order to solve certain tasks. Findings show that both dogs and wolves cooperate intensively with humans and are equally successful, although the animals attain their goals in different ways. In their cooperation with human partners, dogs followed the behavior of the humans while wolves led the interaction: they were more independent.  p 
 p Based on the results of the study, the researchers proposed that dogs were selected for breeding because of their higher submissive tendencies, which helped minimize conflicts over resources and ensured the safe coexistence and cooperation in which humans lead and dogs follow.  p

 p Arctic pride!?  p 
 p Wild Arctic gray wolves ( em Canis lupus arctos  em ) live primarily in the Arctic, the region located above 67° north latitude. The land is covered with snow and ice for most of the year, except for a brief period during the summer. Arctic wolves have adapted well to this icy environment. Atka, like his wild counterparts, had white fur, which allowed him to blend into snowy surroundings. To help reduce heat loss, his ears were rounded, he had a shorter muzzle and shorter legs than other gray wolf subspecies. He also had hair between the pads of his feet and long, thick fur to keep him warm in temperatures that were as low as minus 70° Fahrenheit.  p 
 p  strong  About Atka  strong   p 
 p Atka lived to be the oldest ambassador wolf at the Wolf Conservation Center (WCC), passing away peacefully in September 2018 at 16 years old. He arrived at the WCC from Minnesota when he was just 8 days old.  p 
 p The confident and charismatic ambassador won the hearts and opened the minds of hundreds of thousands of people throughout his storied career.  p 
 p Atka wasn’t just a luminary in the world of conservation, he was a superstar! Thank you, Atka, for allowing the world to form lasting connections with not only you but your wild kin as well. We will always remember and honor your wild legacy.  p
