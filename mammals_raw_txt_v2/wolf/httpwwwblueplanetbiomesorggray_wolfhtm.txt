         Europe can be grayish brown.  font   p

 p  font face="Georgia" color="#000000" The gray wolf has
         many special adaptations. Their coats are made up of wooly
         fur to provide insulation and long guard hairs to keep out
         moisture. The gray wolf's large paws have fleshy pads and
         claws for traction and can spread to provide better support
         in snow. Wolves have a sense of hearing twenty times sharper
         than a human's and have a sense of smell a hundred times
         keener. The wolf's jaws can deliver a crushing pressure of
         over 500 pounds per square inch! Wolves' vision is very
         motion sensitive. They have a reflective retina, called a
         tapetum that enhances their night vision. They can't see
         color. Wolves have great stamina. They can cover a distance
         of more than eighteen miles at a quick trot. They have a top
         speed of about 40 miles per hour.  font   p 
 p  font face="Georgia" color="#000000" The maximum lifespan
         of a wolf is 17 years. Wolves reach sexual maturity at 1
         year for females and 2 years for males. Wolves typically
         mate once every year between January and March. They have a
         gestation period of about 63 days. The average litter size
         is 5 or 6, born in a den, such as a rock cavity or a hole in
         the ground. Wolf pups have a birth weight of about 1 pound.
         They stay with their mother in the den for 8 weeks before
         they are weaned. During that time the other wolves bring
         food for the mother. Wolves are very social animals. They
         live in groups called packs. A typical pack is lead by an
         alpha male and female wolf, which are a breeding pair. The
         other members of the group are their current offspring and
         young wolves who are the previous year's litter. There may
         also be some lower ranking adults. Packs can have as few
         wolves as 4 or as many as 30. There are also many lone
         wolves. The largest wolf pack ever recorded was made up of
         36 members!  font   p 
 p  font face="Georgia" color="#000000" Wolves are
         carnivores. They eat animals like moose, caribou, and other
         deer-like animals. When food is scarce, they will eat
         rodents. They also scavenge. A wolf can eat 22 pounds of
         meat at one meal. The pack members will track down a herd
         and select an old, sick, or young animal. They generally use
         their stamina to wear down prey in long pursuit, but will
         also sprint to catch it. The predatory success of wolves is
         mainly due to the flexibility of their hunting methods. They
         will flush out their prey, stalk it, or use trickery. No
         humans have ever been killed by healthy wolves in North
         America.  font   p 
 p  font face="Georgia" color="#000000" The wolf is at the
         top of the food chain and has no natural enemies. Their only
         threat is humans. Wolves help keep the ecosystem's
         population in check by preying on the weak animals so there
         will be food for the stronger individuals.  font   p 
 p  font face="Georgia" color="#000000" In Canada and
         Alaska, the gray wolf population is stable. In most of North
         America, however, they are an endangered species. In Europe,
         Asia, and Africa, the remaining wolf populations are tiny.
         The largest wolf population in Europe and Asia is found in
         Russia, which includes the Siberian Taiga.  font   p
