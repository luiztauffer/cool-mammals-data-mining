Currently, wolf range has been brought down to the Great lakes, Alaska, Canada, Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies. Thanks to the re-launch of wolves in 1995, YNP is the top favored places to see or hear wolves in their original habitat. Wolves need huge areas of contiguous habitat with mountains terrains. Some wolves including gray ones from Mexico can do well in desert and survive in the southwest. Appropriate habitat should have adequate access to prey, safety from extreme persecution and places with denning and taking shelter.  p 
 p    p 
 p They are very intelligent animals whose upright ears, pointed muzzles, Sharp teeth and inquiring eyes together with more facial features instantly showcase these qualities.  p 
 p Wolves’ weight and size vary widely across the world. Generally, a wolf height varies from  strong 0.6 to 0.95 meters   strong equivalent to 26 to 38 inches at the shoulder, its weight vary from  strong 20- 60 kgs  strong ., where gray wolf being the largest one among other wild canids.

 p Wolves mating season can come anytime between J strong anuary and March  strong . Only the female and male ( em alphas  em ) mate in the pack so as to control their population.  p 
 p The female wolf has five to seven days only to estrus, a condition to conceive. As this happens, the male alpha will thereafter leave the pack for sometimes to avoid distraction from other members of the pack. During breeding season wolves begin to get very affectionate with one another. This comes with the expectation of female ovulation cycle. When the alpha female wolf finally goes into a period known as  strong estrus   strong the male adult wolf and the female wolves spend much time together normally in seclusion.  p 
 p Now in the first five days of estrus, the female alpha will shed a lining of her uterus and will become restrictive to the male. As this happens, female alpha will start ovulation and mating will happen.  The mating test is done over and over during the female brief ovulation period that occurs once in a year one. It is said both the alphas can continue breeding this way till they get 10 years of age.  p 
 p After the female and male wolves have mated, the gestation period runs for  strong 60 and 63 days.  strong  The puppies are  strong born blind, totally deaf and dependent on the mom  strong .

The den is normally located close to water source and open area. The puppies will start to roam up to a mile away from the den exploring the area.  p 
 p At four weeks old, the puppies’ milk teeth have surfaced and they start to eat regurgitated food. At six weeks old the pups are weaned. In the first few weeks they will be growing and the female alpha will spend time with them alone. In the meantime, other members of the pack will join in with caring of the puppies in one way or another. The young ones stand a better chance of surviving due to large contribution by other wolves towards their care, which includes; obtaining food and offering security.  p 
 p After two months since birth, the wolf puppies will be shifted to a secure place which they will live in while some of the mature wolves go hunting. Two or three adult wolves will of course stay back to watch over puppies and provide safety.  p 
 p After several weeks of upkeep, the pups are sometimes allowed to join the rest in the hunt. They are solely allowed to observe until they reach eight months where they will be old enough to take the mantle. Regardless of their rank of age the newborn are given first priority whenever food is tabled within the pack.  p 
 p Allowing the newborn battle for the right to eat, result in secondary ranking being instilled among them which allow them to exercise dominance as well as submission rituals which is important to their impending survival within the pack existence.  p 
 p Typically, wolves reach maturity when they approach two to three years of age. This is the time they feel they need to exit the pack, get mate and being a pack of their own kind.  p
