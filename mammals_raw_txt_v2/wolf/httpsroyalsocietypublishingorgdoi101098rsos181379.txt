The influence of local conditions or experience gained in the natal habitat could improve fitness if dispersing individuals settle in an area with similar habitat characteristics. This process, defined as ‘natal habitat-biased dispersal’ (NHBD), has been used to explain distribution patterns in large carnivores, but actual studies evaluating it are rare. We tested whether grey wolf  i Canis lupus  i  territory establishment was influenced by the habitat characteristics of the natal territory using the long-term monitoring of the Scandinavian wolf population. We paired the locations of natal and established territories, accounted for available habitats along the dispersing route, and compared their habitat characteristics for 271 wolves during 1998–2012. Wolves with the shortest dispersal distances established in natal-like habitat types more than expected by chance, whereas wolves that dispersed longer distances did not show NHBD. The pattern was consistent for male and female wolves, with females showing more NHBD than males. Chances to detect NHBD increased with the size of habitat defined as available. This highlights the importance of considering the biological characteristics of the studied species when defining habitat availability. Our methodological approach can prove useful to inform conservation and management to identify habitats to be selected by reintroduced or naturally expanding populations.  p

Dispersing and eventually settling into a similar habitat is a process termed ‘natal habitat-biased dispersal’ (hereafter, NHBD; [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C4" id="RSOS181379C4R" class="tab-link" 4  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C9" id="RSOS181379C9R" class="tab-link" 9  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C12" id="RSOS181379C12R" class="tab-link" 12  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C13" id="RSOS181379C13R" class="tab-link" 13  a ]).

However, the actual existence of NHBD in large carnivores has been tested only in red wolves  i Canis rufus  i , which showed NHBD [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C21" id="RSOS181379C21R" class="tab-link" 21  a ], and American black bears  i Ursus americanus  i , which did not [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C22" id="RSOS181379C22R" class="tab-link" 22  a ]. In red wolves, 71% of pups and 82% of older individuals settled in areas similar to their natal habitats, which may reflect selection for areas with higher prey availability [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C21" id="RSOS181379C21R" class="tab-link" 21  a ]. The social structure, high mobility and territorial behaviour of grey wolves make them good candidates for the study of dispersal [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C1" id="RSOS181379C1R" class="tab-link" 1  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C23" id="RSOS181379C23R" class="tab-link" 23  a ]. However, long-range movements by wolves have rarely been studied at fine scales because of logistical and methodological limitations [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C24" id="RSOS181379C24R" class="tab-link" 24  a ], and because it involves complex relations with habitat characteristics [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C1" id="RSOS181379C1R" class="tab-link" 1  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C23" id="RSOS181379C23R" class="tab-link" 23  a ]. Wolves are generalists in terms of habitat requirements [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C25" id="RSOS181379C25R" class="tab-link" 25  a ], but preferences for flat and forested areas [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C26" id="RSOS181379C26R" class="tab-link" 26  a ], shrub lands [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C27" id="RSOS181379C27R" class="tab-link" 27  a ], and habitats selected by their main prey species [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C28" id="RSOS181379C28R" class="tab-link" 28  a ], for instance, have been documented. Interspecific competition, e.g. with brown bears  i Ursus arctos  i  [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C29" id="RSOS181379C29R" class="tab-link" 29  a ], and general avoidance of human activity [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C30" id="RSOS181379C30R" class="tab-link" 30  a ] can also affect the establishment of wolf territories. Indeed, wolves' avoidance of human activity [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C30" id="RSOS181379C30R" class="tab-link" 30  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C31" id="RSOS181379C31R" class="tab-link" 31  a ] may lead them to select a particular habitat type regardless of the natal habitat characteristics, i.e. several factors may affect whether NHBD exists. However, the long association of young wolves with the parents may improve the ability of young wolves to capture and handle prey in the natal territory [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C32" id="RSOS181379C32R" class="tab-link" 32  a ], which may favour selection of similar habitat types when wolves disperse. Furthermore, NHBD may favour selecting habitats particularly rich in prey ( i sensu  i  [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C21" id="RSOS181379C21R" class="tab-link" 21  a ]).  p

For instance, shortage of the natal-like habitat type in the area where an animal disperses to and eventually establishes may limit the occurrence of NHBD. Accounting for availability allows differentiating if the lack of NHBD reflects an individual choice and or the lack of available habitats. Furthermore, the extent of the area considered available for a dispersing individual may lead to different interpretations on the occurrence of, or lack of, NHBD. Although considering habitat availability is central in habitat selection studies [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C33" id="RSOS181379C33R" class="tab-link" 33  a ], it has rarely been considered when studying NHBD.  p

However, its expansion has been shaped by constraints, such as legal control, poaching [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C35" id="RSOS181379C35R" class="tab-link" 35  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C36" id="RSOS181379C36R" class="tab-link" 36  a ], and low survival of immigrants crossing the Fennoscandian reindeer  i Rangifer tarandus  i  management area, which restricts Scandinavian wolf genetic exchange with the founder population in Finland-Russia. Taking advantage of the detailed, long-term monitoring of the Scandinavian wolf population, we tested the NHBD hypothesis, i.e. we examined if dispersing wolves were influenced by their natal habitat characteristics when choosing a new territory to settle within the distribution range during 1998–2012 in central Scandinavia (electronic supplementary material, figure A1, appendix 1). Using the reconstructed pedigree of this wolf population [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C34" id="RSOS181379C34R" class="tab-link" 34  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C37" id="RSOS181379C37R" class="tab-link" 37  a ], we defined the natal territory as the spatial location of the territory where individuals were born, and the established territory as the location of the territory of the first detected successful pairing with a mate. We studied the similarities between natal, available and established territories, while controlling for habitat availability, by characterizing their landscape attributes with several environmental variables. We predicted that, if Scandinavian wolves perform NHBD, they would be more likely to establish in a territory with habitat characteristics similar to those of the natal territory. Because dispersal distance may play an important role in habitat similarity between natal and established territories [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C12" id="RSOS181379C12R" class="tab-link" 12  a ] and gender influences the dispersal process in many species, with mammals often exhibiting male-biased dispersal [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C38" id="RSOS181379C38R" class="tab-link" 38  a ], we checked if dispersal distance and gender could be important factors to detect NHBD in wolves. Because we did not have access to the actual dispersal trajectories of wolves, i.e. only the location of the natal and established territories was known, we defined habitat availability with different methods, as the definition of availability could also influence the chance of detecting NHBD.  p

Because it is still a very coarse definition of the habitat available encountered during dispersal, we checked the sensitivity of our results to another definition of availability. We created 11 random points, as the location of potentially available territories, uniformly distributed within buffers created around a straight line drawn between the natal and established territory of each dispersing individual. We sequentially repeated this approach using buffer radius ranging from 25 000 to 300 000 m. We used different buffer sizes around the straight line between natal and established territories to test the sensitivity of our conclusions to the definition of availability (ranging from scenarios where availability was limited around the straight line between the natal and established territory, to scenarios where the whole study area extent was defined as available).  p

First, we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the matrix containing the environmental variables characterizing the natal, available and established territories. We also included year as a continuous variable to control for a potential time effect. All variables were standardized. Second, we used the  i K  i -means clustering method over the five Principal Components of the PCA to group wolf territories with similar habitat characteristics in 6 clusters (electronic supplementary material, tables A1 and A2; appendix 3; figure A10, appendix 5). Therefore, each cluster contained natal, available and established territories that shared habitat similarities.  p

In addition, we also used Partition Around Medoids (PAM), hierarchical clustering methods, and a distance metric of similarity to the natal habitat (see electronic supplementary material, appendix 4) to define habitat similarity.  p

The established territory was paired with the 11 available territories (1 : 11) and each individual was used as a ‘stratum’ [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C55" id="RSOS181379C55R" class="tab-link" 55  a ]. We created the NHBD binary variable denoting whether each available and established territory of a focal individual were assigned to the same cluster as the natal territory. A positive beta estimate for the variable NHBD would confirm the NHBD hypothesis. Because of the potential influence of dispersing distance (electronic supplementary material, figure A5, appendix 2) on habitat selection (e.g. [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C56" id="RSOS181379C56R" class="tab-link" 56  a ]), we tested the NHBD hypothesis for short (less than 40 km), medium (40–200 km) and long (more than 200 km) dispersing wolves. We also tested the influence of sex in NHBD. We chose to discretize the dispersing distance variable to avoid having to compute a three-way interaction between the NHBD*sex*distance, while controlling for nonlinear effects of dispersal distance. We included the habitat variables described above to control for avoidance selection of specific habitat types. We tested for correlation among variables and excluded human-dominated areas, agricultural lands, altitude, roughness, mires and secondary roads from all models (Pearson coefficient &gt; 0.6). Additionally, we tested whether wolf density could affect NHBD by including an interaction term between wolf density and the variable NHBD. We checked for NHBD using conditional logistic regression over a different number of clusters, different clustering methods, and a metric of similarity to the natal territory (electronic supplementary material, appendix 4), and under different definitions of habitat availability. We checked whether individuals significantly selected or avoided the natal habitat type by using  i p  i -values &lt; 0.05 as a threshold. All analyses were conducted in R v. 3.1.1 [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C57" id="RSOS181379C57R" class="tab-link" 57  a ].  p

Whereas our results show some support for the NHBD hypothesis, they make it conditional on both biological traits (i.e. wolf dispersal distance and sex) and the methodological approach used for defining habitat availability. Generally, the chances of detecting NHBD increased with the size of the area that was defined as available for a given individual to establish its territory. However, short-dispersing individuals were more prone to select habitat similar to their natal territory, regardless of the methods used (i.e. habitat similarity and habitat availability definitions, figures  a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F2" id="RSOS181379F2R" class="" 2  a  and  a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" 3  a ). This pattern was generally consistent for both male and female wolves, with females showing NHBD more than males ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" figure 3  a ). Besides novel results in terms of NHBD, Scandinavian wolves selected for forested, mountainous terrain, and areas inhabited by other wolves, but avoided steeper terrain, areas with higher human accessibility, and areas inhabited by bears ( a class="ref showTableEvent" data-id="RSOS181379TB2" href="#RSOS181379TB2" table 2  a ) when establishing their territories. These results are in agreement with previous studies on wolf habitat selection [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C26" id="RSOS181379C26R" class="tab-link" 26  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C28" id="RSOS181379C28R" class="tab-link" 28  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C29" id="RSOS181379C29R" class="tab-link" 29  a ].  p

The chance of finding similarity between natal and established territories is linked to dispersal distance, as availability of the natal habitat type is generally higher nearby the natal territory (electronic supplementary material, figure A8, appendix 3; [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C12" id="RSOS181379C12R" class="tab-link" 12  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C58" id="RSOS181379C58R" class="tab-link" 58  a ]). Therefore, regardless of what is causing individual variation in dispersal distances [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C24" id="RSOS181379C24R" class="tab-link" 24  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C41" id="RSOS181379C41R" class="tab-link" 41  a ], a long-dispersing individual is less likely to find available habitat similar to its natal habitat. A long-dispersing individual has likely encountered similar habitat types during the first stage of its dispersal, i.e. close to its territory, as allowed by our definition of availability, but it may simply not be able to perform NHBD, because of a lack of similar habitat available once it has moved far away from its natal territory. On the contrary, an individual having a short dispersal distance is more likely to find habitat available similar to its natal habitat. Therefore, in order to perform NHBD, an individual should likely stay in the vicinity of its natal territory. There might be various reasons explaining inter-individual variation in dispersal distance [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C38" id="RSOS181379C38R" class="tab-link" 38  a ], and we did not specifically test whether NHBD is one of them. However, the fact that short-dispersing individuals tended to favour habitat similar to their natal territory, suggests that NHBD is an arguable reason for short dispersal distance.  p

Therefore, finding NHBD only for short dispersers could reflect both habitat availability and behavioural responses. The ability to handle, capture and process food is improved by experience in the natal habitat [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C11" id="RSOS181379C11R" class="tab-link" 11  a ] and may explain the presence of NHBD. Wolves live in packs and the long association with the parental pair could increase offspring opportunities to learn about components of hunting behaviour that are not innate [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C32" id="RSOS181379C32R" class="tab-link" 32  a ]. This learning process may favour the selection of natal-like habitat and or prey types, and this was the reason used to explain why red wolves selected habitats rich in prey and similar to their natal areas [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C21" id="RSOS181379C21R" class="tab-link" 21  a ]. Although the wolf is considered a generalist species, prey and habitat specialization have also been shown in a grey wolf population, where two genetic clusters were associated with two different habitat types [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C19" id="RSOS181379C19R" class="tab-link" 19  a ]. Beyond the potential mechanism explaining NHBD for short dispersers and its lack for medium and long dispersers, our results reinforce the importance of considering the effect of dispersal distances when studying habitat selection [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C56" id="RSOS181379C56R" class="tab-link" 56  a ].  p

Females showed more NHBD than males for all our definitions of habitat availability ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" figure 3  a ), resembling the pattern found in many mammals, with females often being more philopatric to their natal habitats than males (e.g. [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C3" id="RSOS181379C3R" class="tab-link" 3  a ]).  p

Previous research has shown bias in habitat selection results when the analytical method does not take the animal's functional response into account, i.e. its choices depending on what is available [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C59" id="RSOS181379C59R" class="tab-link" 59  a ]. In our study, chances to detect NHBD increased with the size of the area defined as available ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" figure 3  a ), which probably included a larger, more contrasting gradient of habitat types (e.g. see the distribution of clusters of habitat types in electronic supplementary material, figure A8, appendix 3) than smaller areas. An ideal way to deal with the problem of availability definition in studies of habitat selection during dispersal would be to account for habitat availability within the observed dispersing route of each individual (e.g. GPS-based trajectories). Including this information is frequently unfeasible in financial and logistical terms, and particularly challenging for secretive animals [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C59" id="RSOS181379C59R" class="tab-link" 59  a ], so studies integrating dispersal behaviour and availability are valuable (e.g. [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C60" id="RSOS181379C60R" class="tab-link" 60  a ]).  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" The correlated random walks (CRW) that we used are a simplification of an individual dispersal behaviour, because CRW do not account for habitat selection during the dispersal process. However, we suggest that sampling availability with CRW may reflect how a wolf, in this case, encounters and eventually selects habitat better than arbitrary buffers that lead to varying NHBD results, yet highlighting useful patterns ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" figure 3  a ). CRW informed by the routes between the natal and the established territory of GPS-collared wolves also avoided the inclusion of habitats that, while being theoretically available for a dispersing wolf, are not likely to be encountered during its dispersal process, which often occurs in straightforward routes (electronic supplementary material, figures A2 and A3, appendix 2).  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" Nevertheless, we also created progressively larger buffer sizes as an alternative method to quantify habitat availability and its potential influence on NHBD. The combination of wolf dispersal distances and different scenarios of habitat availability led to some variation in the magnitude and direction of the NHBD response in Scandinavian wolves (figures  a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F2" id="RSOS181379F2R" class="" 2  a  and  a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" 3  a ), which reinforces the importance of defining availability [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C33" id="RSOS181379C33R" class="tab-link" 33  a ] and the call for caution when interpreting habitat selection results [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C59" id="RSOS181379C59R" class="tab-link" 59  a ]. Quantifying habitat availability for dispersing individuals is indeed a recognized challenge in habitat selection studies [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C61" id="RSOS181379C61R" class="tab-link" 61  a ]. The few, previous attempts to test NHBD on large carnivores did not quantify habitat availability, but used a proxy of land cover types in natal and established territories [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C21" id="RSOS181379C21R" class="tab-link" 21  a ], or applied a previous map of habitat suitability [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C22" id="RSOS181379C22R" class="tab-link" 22  a ]. Interestingly, our analyses showed that individuals with short dispersal distances performed NHBD more than medium and long dispersers did (figures  a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F2" id="RSOS181379F2R" class="" 2  a  and  a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F3" id="RSOS181379F3R" class="" 3  a ), regardless of our alternative definitions of habitat availability.  p

Several studies have actually shown the negative influence of humans on wolf occurrence [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C29" id="RSOS181379C29R" class="tab-link" 29  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C31" id="RSOS181379C31R" class="tab-link" 31  a ] and mortality [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C35" id="RSOS181379C35R" class="tab-link" 35  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C36" id="RSOS181379C36R" class="tab-link" 36  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C41" id="RSOS181379C41R" class="tab-link" 41  a ] in Scandinavia and other areas [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C30" id="RSOS181379C30R" class="tab-link" 30  a ]. The high impact that human activities have on Scandinavian wolves, e.g. through poaching, legal control actions, and low survival outside the breeding range [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C35" id="RSOS181379C35R" class="tab-link" 35  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C36" id="RSOS181379C36R" class="tab-link" 36  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C41" id="RSOS181379C41R" class="tab-link" 41  a ], likely masks or overrides cues obtained on their natal habitats, which in turn can reduce the probability of finding a stronger pattern of NHBD in this wolf population. For instance, individuals might select for habitats particularly rich in prey, but such areas could be avoided, rather than selected, if human activity levels are just too high.  p

To test for NHBD in Scandinavian wolves, we used different habitat classifications through different clustering methods and number of clusters. The observed pattern on NHBD remained consistent with different methods of habitat similarity definition ( a data-tab="pane-pcw-Figures" href="#RSOS181379F2" id="RSOS181379F2R" class="" figure 2  a ; electronic supplementary material, figure A9, appendix 4), which reinforces the robustness of that pattern. We selected the habitat types representing the most important factors that affected wolf habitat selection in Scandinavia [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C29" id="RSOS181379C29R" class="tab-link" 29  a ]. However, since habitat selection is a hierarchical process acting at several spatio-temporal scales [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C33" id="RSOS181379C33R" class="tab-link" 33  a ], there might be other important habitat types that were not captured by our definition of habitats at the spatial scale of our study.  p 
 p xmlns:ali="http:  www.niso.org schemas ali 1.0 " xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:oasis="http:  www.niso.org standards z39-96 ns oasis-exchange table" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:bkstg="http:  www.atypon.com backstage-ns" We tried to optimize information on natal and established territories extracted from genetic pedigrees to mirror the dispersal mechanism, accounting for dispersal distances [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C56" id="RSOS181379C56R" class="tab-link" 56  a ], and including prior knowledge of wolf behaviour when defining availability. We encourage other studies to further account for more factors that may affect dispersal, e.g. the landscape context dependency [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C65" id="RSOS181379C65R" class="tab-link" 65  a ], and individual variation in wolf behaviour and physiological state [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C32" id="RSOS181379C32R" class="tab-link" 32  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C66" id="RSOS181379C66R" class="tab-link" 66  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C67" id="RSOS181379C67R" class="tab-link" 67  a ]. We also suggest that performing our methodological approach for carnivore populations inhabiting more heterogeneous landscapes offers potential to reveal if NHBD occurs. In southern Europe, for instance, wolf populations range from high, forested mountains to lower, mostly treeless agricultural areas, therefore exhibiting contrasting diets (e.g. [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C68" id="RSOS181379C68R" class="tab-link" 68  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C69" id="RSOS181379C69R" class="tab-link" 69  a ]). Such habitat heterogeneity may help to understand the role of different landscape features in the dispersal process of wolves and other large carnivores across their distribution range. Indeed, testing for NHBD with spatial locations of natal and established territories extracted from genetic pedigrees and or using locations of GPS-collared animals can provide essential information for conservation and management. For instance, to delineate sensitive areas and inform reintroduction or translocation programmes about the habitat types that will be more likely occupied by released animals (e.g. [ a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C10" id="RSOS181379C10R" class="tab-link" 10  a , a data-tab="pane-pcw-references" href="#RSOS181379C11" id="RSOS181379C11R" class="tab-link" 11  a ]); and to forecast expansion fronts of currently expanding populations of large carnivores. We therefore encourage researchers to proceed with similar studies, as they can improve our ecological understanding of dispersal processes, while providing essential information for practitioners.  p
