 p The arctic wolf, also known as the  strong white wolf  strong  or  strong polar wolf  strong , is a sub-species of the  strong grey wolf   strong found in northern Canada. They are usually pure white in colour (but can also sometimes be grey), and slightly smaller than grey wolves, with smaller ears and shorter snouts to help retain heat. They range between 90 and 180cm in length (including the tail) and weigh between 45 and 70kg. Males are generally larger than females.  p 
 p Arctic wolves have two layers of fur: a long, thick outer layer, and a dense inner layer that acts as a barrier against the cold and the wet. This helps them to retain heat during the winter.  p 
 p Arctic wolves live in  strong packs  strong  of 5 to 12 individuals, with one dominant pair. The alpha male is the largest in the pack and continues growing after the other wolves has stopped.  p 
 p Arctic wolves are native to the Queen Elizabeth Islands in northern Canada and parts of northern Greenland, located within the  strong Arctic circle  strong .  p

 p Packs can roam over  strong territories  strong  of up to 1000 square miles, and as such territories can often overlap. They mark their territory with urine and other scent markers and can be heard  strong howling  strong  to alert other wolves to their presence.  p 
 p Arctic wolves are  strong carnivorous.   strong In the wild, they primarily feed on muskox, caribou and Arctic hares, but also lemmings, reindeer, Arctic fox and birds. Due to the harsh environment they inhabit, they usually have to eat whatever they can find, and so diet varies over each season.  p 
 p Muskox are too large for any one wolf to kill, and so the wolves hunt in packs. A single muskox could feed an entire pack for up to a week.  p 
 p Arctic wolves will usually chase their prey over long distances, and there is evidence to suggest they track the muskox migration.  p 
 p In wolf packs only the alpha male and female are allowed to breed. Females give birth to 2 to 3 pups in late May early June after a gestation period of 53 to 61 days. The pups are kept safe in the rocky outcrops or caves available (since they can’t dig dens in the permafrost), as they are blind and helpless at birth.  p 
 p At birth, wolf pups tend to have darker fur and blue eyes. This will change to the white grey fur and yellow orange eyes of an adult at between 8 and 16 weeks old. Pups will leave the den at around 3 to 6 weeks old, and then join the pack at around 3 months old. They will stay with their mother for a further 2 years.  p 
 p Arctic wolves can live to be over 18 years old in captivity. In the wild the average lifespan is between 7 and 10 years.  p 
 p IUCN Conservation Status: Least Concern  p 
 p Population Trend: Stable  p 
 p Arctic wolves are the only subspecies of wolf still found over its entire native range. This is because they so rarely come into contact with humans, and so are not under threat from hunting or persecution.  p 
 p Like most animals, Arctic wolves could come under threat from climate change in the near future. Changing weather patterns could reduce prey availability and habitat suitability.  p 
 p Our Arctic wolves, Aria and Luna, are two sisters who were born in Hungary in 2011. They arrived at the zoo in 2014.  p 
 p Their names come from the Latin words for “air” and “moon”!  p
