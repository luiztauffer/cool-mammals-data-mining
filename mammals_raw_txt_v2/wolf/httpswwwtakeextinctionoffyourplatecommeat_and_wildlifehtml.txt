 p Wild  animals suffer not only the collateral damage of meat-related deforestation,  drought, pollution and climate change, but also direct targeting by the meat industry.  From grazing animals to predators, native species are frequently killed to  protect meat-production profits. Grass-eating species such as elk, deer and  pronghorn have been killed en masse to reserve more feed for cattle. Important  habitat-creating animals such as beavers and prairie dogs have been decimated  because they disrupt the homogenous landscapes desired by livestock managers.  p 
 p "Predator control" programs designed to protect  the livestock industry helped drive keystone predators like California grizzly  bears and Mexican gray wolves extinct in their ecosystems. Adding  insult to injury — and flying in the face of modern conservation science — the  livestock industry remains the leading stodgy opponent to otherwise-popular  efforts to recover species like the Mexican gray wolf in Arizona and New  Mexico.  p 
 p A recent article about the connection between livestock production and the  decline of wolves and other carnivores describes some of the brutal methods  used to target predators:  p 
 p  em “To support a global rise in per-capita  meat-eating, livestock farming continues to expand, shrinking and fragmenting  natural habitats in the process. And when cramped predators adapt by  preying upon livestock, some ranchers go to extreme measures to keep them away,  such as strapping pouches of neurotoxins to the necks of grazing lambs, or  calling upon the United States Department of Agriculture to shoot down  predators from government helicopters.”   em [ a href="references.html#9" 9  a ]  p 
 p More  than 175 threatened or endangered species are imperiled by livestock on federal  lands [ a href="references.html#10" 10  a ], where livestock grazing is promoted, protected and subsidized on  270 million acres of our public lands in 11 western states. Livestock grazing —  not including the large portion of agriculture devoted to cattle production or  other forms of meat production — is among the greatest direct threats to  imperiled species, affecting 14 percent of threatened or endangered animals and  33 percent of threatened or endangered plants [ a href="references.html#11" 11  a ].  p 
 p In addition, at the behest of  ranchers, a federal agency known as a href="http:  www.biologicaldiversity.org wildlifeservices" target="blank"  Wildlife Services  a  shoots, traps, and  poisons millions of animals every year, including wolves and foxes and bears in  National Forests, to make more room for cows and other ranched animals.  p 
 p Animal agriculture is responsible for at least 14.5 percent of human-induced global greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States cattle emit about 5.5 million metric tons of methane — a greenhouse gas 25 times more  potent than carbon dioxide — accounting for 20 percent of the country’s  a href="http:  www.biologicaldiversity.org programs climate_law_institute global_warming_what_how_why methane index.html" target="_blank" methane  a  emissions [ a href="references.html#2" 2  a ].  p 
 p In addition to the astounding levels of emissions that come from the feeding,  digestion and transportation involved in raising livestock, the staggering  amount of land used for feed crops and grazing multiplies the carbon hoofprint  of meat consumption.  p 
 p Global  warming presents the gravest threat to life on Earth. Meat production is a  major contributor to the rising temperatures that are further altering or  eliminating habitat, reducing food sources, and causing drought beyond the  immediate demands of raising livestock.  p 
 p In the United States, 80 percent of  agricultural land is used for raising animals and feed crops. That’s almost  half the land mass of the lower 48 states dedicated to feeding the nation’s  taste for beef, chicken and pork [ a href="references.html#14" 14  a ]. More than half of the grain grown in the  country goes toward feeding livestock, [ a href="references.html#15" 15  a ] and nearly half of the water used goes toward meat production  [ a href="references.html#16" 16  a ].  a href="http:  www.factoryfarmmap.org " target="_blank" Check out this  interactive map to learn more em .  em   a   p 
 p  a href="http:  www.biologicaldiversity.org programs public_lands grazing index.html" target="_blank" Grazing  a  is a serious threat to  wildlife and ecosystems, particularly on federal lands. The ecological costs of  livestock grazing exceed that of any other western land use — yet it’s highly  subsidized by the government, under pressure from Big Ag. In the arid  Southwest, livestock grazing is the most widespread cause of wildlife  endangerment. By destroying vegetation, damaging wildlife habitats and  disrupting natural processes, such grazing wreaks ecological havoc on riparian  areas, rivers, deserts, grasslands and forests alike — causing significant harm  to native species and the ecosystems on which they depend.  p 
 p Grazing cattle destroy native  vegetation, damage soils and stream banks, and contaminate waterways with fecal  waste. After decades of livestock grazing, once-lush streams and riparian  forests have been reduced to flat, dry wastelands; once-rich topsoil has been  turned to dust, causing soil erosion, stream sedimentation and wholesale  elimination of many aquatic habitats; overgrazing of  fire-carrying grasses has starved some western forests of fire, making them  overly dense and prone to unnaturally severe fires.  p 
 p Most U.S. cattle are “finished” in  feedlots, where thousands of animals are kept closely confined in pens and fed  a diet of grain, antibiotics and other ingredients to prepare them for  slaughter. Pigs and chickens are also typically raised in “concentrated animal  feeding operations,” or CAFOs. In addition to inhumane conditions for the farm  animals, CAFOs generate massive amounts of waste, which causes air and water  pollution.  p 
 p Livestock  produce 500 million tons of manure per year [ a href="references.html#17" 17  a ]. Agricultural pollution is a  leading source of water-quality problems, with factory farms polluting 35,000  miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminating groundwater in 17 states, in  addition to impairing wetlands, lakes and estuaries [ a href="references.html#18" 18  a ]. Meat production is  also responsible for 80 percent of antibiotic use and 37 percent of pesticide  use [ a href="references.html#21" 21  a ], creating health threats to children and wildlife.  p
