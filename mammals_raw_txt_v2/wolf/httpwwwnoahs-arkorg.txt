 p Our 9th Annual Zebra Dash &amp; 1 Mile Fun Run fundraiser event is coming up on Saturday, April 6th at 9am! Join us for an exciting day at the sanctuary running through the pasture, trails and animal habitats. This unique 5K winds through the pasture (yes, the animals will be there!) on to a beautiful trail and then you do a loop around the animal habitats. br  br 
The one-mile fun run is perfect for small kids and strollers because it's on the paved walkway that winds through the animal habitats past the bears, lions, tigers, primates, and more! Kick off spring with a race like no other, then stick around to tour the sanctuary.   a href="http:  www.revolutionrunning.net %20" target="_blank" Register by clicking here!  a
