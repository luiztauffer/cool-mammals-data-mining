There was evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American gray wolves.

Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity.

The study supports the findings of previous studies that North American gray wolves and other wolf-like canids were the result of complex gray wolf and coyote mixing. A polar wolf from Greenland and a coyote from Mexico represented the purest specimens. The coyotes from Alaska, California, Alabama, and Quebec show almost no wolf ancestry.

The eastern wolf (Angonquin Provincial Park) is genetically closely related to the Great Lakes wolf (Minnesota, Isle Royale National Park).

  p 
 p The actual killing method varies according to prey species. With large prey, mature wolves usually avoid attacking frontally, instead focusing on the rear and sides of the animal. Large prey, such as moose, is killed by biting large chunks of flesh from the soft  a href=" wiki Perineum" title="Perineum" perineum  a  area, causing massive  a href=" wiki Blood_loss" class="mw-redirect" title="Blood loss" blood loss  a . Such bites can cause wounds 10–15 cm (3.9–5.9 in) in length, with three such bites to the perineum usually being sufficient to bring down a large deer in optimum health. sup id="cite_ref-g45_107-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-g45-107" [105]  a   sup  With medium-sized prey such as  a href=" wiki Roe_deer" title="Roe deer" roe deer  a  or  a href=" wiki Sheep" title="Sheep" sheep  a , wolves kill by biting the throat, severing nerve tracks and the  a href=" wiki Carotid_artery" title="Carotid artery" carotid artery  a , thus causing the animal to die within a few seconds to a minute.

 p  a href=" wiki Olfaction" title="Olfaction" Olfaction  a  is probably the wolf's most acute sense, and plays a fundamental role in communication. The wolf has a large number of  a href=" wiki Apocrine_sweat_gland" title="Apocrine sweat gland" apocrine sweat glands  a  on the face, lips, back, and between the toes. The odor produced by these glands varies according to the individual wolf's  a href=" wiki Microflora" class="mw-redirect" title="Microflora" microflora  a  and diet, giving each a distinct "odor fingerprint". A combination of apocrine and  a href=" wiki Eccrine_sweat_gland" title="Eccrine sweat gland" eccrine sweat glands  a  on the feet allows the wolf to deposit its scent whilst scratching the ground, which usually occurs after urine marking and defecation during the  a href=" wiki Breeding_season" class="mw-redirect" title="Breeding season" breeding season  a . The  a href=" wiki Hair_follicle" title="Hair follicle" follicles  a  present on the guard hairs from the wolf's back have clusters of apocrine and  a href=" wiki Sebaceous_gland" title="Sebaceous gland" sebaceous glands  a  at their bases.

 p During the breeding season, female wolves secrete  a href=" wiki Vaginal_secretion" class="mw-redirect" title="Vaginal secretion" substances from the vagina  a , which communicate the females' reproductive state, and can be detected by males from long distances. Urine marking is the best-studied means of  a href=" wiki Olfactory_communication" class="mw-redirect" title="Olfactory communication" olfactory communication  a  in wolves. Its exact function is debated, though most researchers agree that its primary purpose is to establish boundaries. Wolves urine mark more frequently and vigorously in unfamiliar areas, or areas of intrusion, where the scent of other wolves or canids is present. So-called  a href=" wiki Raised_leg_urination" class="mw-redirect" title="Raised leg urination" raised leg urination  a  (RLU) is more common in male wolves than in females, and may serve the purpose of maximizing the possibility of detection by conspecifics, as well as reflect the height of the marking wolf.

During the autumn-spring period, when wolves are more active, they willingly lie out in the open, whatever their location. Actual dens are usually constructed for pups during the summer period. When building dens, females make use of natural shelters such as fissures in rocks, cliffs overhanging riverbanks and holes thickly covered by vegetation. Sometimes, the den is the appropriated burrow of smaller animals such as foxes, badgers or marmots. An appropriated den is often widened and partly remade. On rare occasions, female wolves dig burrows themselves, which are usually small and short with 1–3 openings. The den is usually constructed not more than 500 m (550 yd) away from a water source, sup id="cite_ref-heptner1998_10-26" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-heptner1998-10" [9]  a   sup  and typically faces southwards, thus ensuring enough sunlight exposure, keeping the denning area relatively snow free. sup id="cite_ref-paquet2003_5-5" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-paquet2003-5" [4]  a   sup  Resting places, play areas for the pups and food remains are commonly found around wolf dens.

 p The gray wolf was once one of the world's most widely distributed mammals, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15°N latitude in North America and 12°N in India. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one-third, because of livestock predation and fear of attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of  a href=" wiki Western_Europe" title="Western Europe" Western Europe  a , in Mexico and much of the United States. In modern times, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada,  a href=" wiki Alaska" title="Alaska" Alaska  a  and the northern U.S.,  a href=" wiki Northern_Europe" title="Northern Europe" Europe  a  and  a href=" wiki Northern_Asia" class="mw-redirect" title="Northern Asia" Asia  a  from about 75°N to 12°N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species.

 p Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations. sup id="cite_ref-lescureaux2014_232-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-lescureaux2014-232" [230]  a   sup

Predatory attacks (attacks by wolves treating humans as food) may be preceded by a long period of  a href=" wiki Habituation" title="Habituation" habituation  a , in which wolves gradually lose their fear of humans. The victims are repeatedly bitten on the head and face, and are then dragged off and consumed, unless the wolves are driven off. Such attacks typically occur only locally, and do not stop until the wolves involved are eliminated. Predatory attacks can occur at any time of the year, with a peak in the June–August period, when the chances of people entering forested areas (for livestock  a href=" wiki Grazing" title="Grazing" grazing  a  or berry and mushroom picking) increase, sup id="cite_ref-linnell_25-3" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-linnell-25" [24]  a   sup  though cases of non-rabid wolf attacks in winter have been recorded in  a href=" wiki Belarus" title="Belarus" Belarus  a ,  a href=" wiki Kirov_Oblast" title="Kirov Oblast" Kirov  a  and  a href=" wiki Irkutsk_Oblast" title="Irkutsk Oblast" Irkutsk  a  oblasts,  a href=" wiki Karelia" title="Karelia" Karelia  a  and  a href=" wiki Ukraine" title="Ukraine" Ukraine  a . sup id="cite_ref-heptner1998_10-41" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-heptner1998-10" [9]  a   sup  Also, wolves with pups experience greater food stresses during this period. sup id="cite_ref-heptner1998_10-42" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-heptner1998-10" [9]  a   sup

Cases of  a href=" wiki Rabies" title="Rabies" rabid  a  wolves are low when compared to other species, as wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected by animals such as dogs, jackals and foxes.

Wolves apparently develop the "furious" phase of rabies to a very high degree which, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals, sup id="cite_ref-linnell_25-4" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-linnell-25" [24]  a   sup  with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs. sup id="cite_ref-heptner1998_10-43" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-heptner1998-10" [9]  a   sup  Rabid wolves usually act alone, travelling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. The victims are chosen at random, though the majority of cases involve adult men. During the 50 years to 2002, there were eight fatal attacks in Europe and Russia, and more than 200 in southern Asia. sup id="cite_ref-linnell_25-5" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-linnell-25" [24]  a   sup  Between 2005–2010, two people were killed in North America. sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-240" [238]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-241" [239]  a   sup
