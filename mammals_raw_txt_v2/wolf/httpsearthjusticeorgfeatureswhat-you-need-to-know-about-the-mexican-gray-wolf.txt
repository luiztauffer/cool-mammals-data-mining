 p  strong In 1976,  strong  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lists the Mexican gray wolf as endangered after a federal program exterminated all but seven lobos.  p 
 p  strong In 1982,  strong  the service issues a placeholder “recovery plan,” a legally required blueprint for the restoration of federally endangered species.  p 
 p  strong In 1998,  strong  a small population of captive-born  i lobos  i  all descendants of the surviving seven is released into the Blue Range Wilderness on the New Mexico-Arizona border.  p 
 p The service controversially designates the  i lobos  i  a nonessential experimental population, which allows for the “take”—shooting, trapping, capture, or harm—of wolves in the wild.  p 
 p  strong In 1995, 2003, and 2012,  strong  under pressure from state hunting and livestock interests, the service abandons three separate attempts to replace the temporary 1982 document with a final plan.  p 
 p The wild population languishes. The slow release of captive lobos, poaching, and other human-caused deaths impede the population’s growth.  p 
 p  strong In 2009,  strong  fewer than 50 wolves and only two breeding pairs are left in the wild.   p 
 p  strong In 2014,  strong  Earthjustice sues the service for its more than 30-year delay to develop a valid recovery plan.  p 
 p  strong In May 2016,  strong  Earthjustice reaches an agreement that the service must finalize a plan by November 2017.  p 
 p  strong In November 2017,  strong  a final recovery plan is due. But will it be based on science or be influenced by those opposed to the recovery of the  i lobos  i  in the American southwest?  p 
 p State governors announce opposition to wolf recovery despite a population of about only 100 wolves in the wild. A court grants New Mexico a temporary ban on further release of Mexican gray wolves.  p

 p “We reached the old wolf in time to watch a fierce green fire dying in her eyes. I realized then, and have known ever since, that there was something new to me in those eyes—something known only to her and to the mountain. I was young then, and full of trigger-itch; I thought that because fewer wolves meant more deer, that no wolves would mean hunters’ paradise. But after seeing the green fire die, I sensed that neither the wolf nor the mountain agreed with such a view.”  p
