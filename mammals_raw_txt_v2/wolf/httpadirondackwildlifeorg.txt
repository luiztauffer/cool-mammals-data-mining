Refuge Center is located at 977 Springfield Road, in
Wilmington, New York, on 50 acres, along the West Branch of the Ausable
River,
about a mile downstream from Whiteface Mountain, on that section of the
river
called "Lake Everest."  Wendy Hall has Federal and State licences
for
wildlife rehabilitation and wildlife education, and we are available to
do
presentations with wildlife for schools, churches, hotels and other
organizations.   span   b  span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'  a href="http:  www.adirondackwildlife.org School_Presentations.html"  b  i  span style="color: blue;" For sample, click here  span   i   b   a  b . br

When you work with support from local veterinarians to care for sick or
injured
wildlife, there are three common outcomes: naturally, some animals die
despite
your best efforts, while most recover to the point where they are
able to
forage and  or hunt, and can be released into the wild.  The
critters
who remain in our care, and are used in educational demonstrations and
displays, are animals who are generally healthy, but are no longer able
to make a living in nature.  br

The Refuge Center includes two miles of educational hiking trails, and
a Public Fishing Access trail, which winds its way along
the West Branch of the Ausable River
and along three river sloughs, through forest and meadow. Our
enclosures for
education
birds include Red-Tailed Hawks, Broad-Winged Hawks, Rough-Legged Hawks,
Swainsons Hawks, Peregrine Falcons, Great Horned Owls, Snowy Owls,
Barred Owls,
Screech
Owls, Turkey Vultures and Ravens.  The refuge mascots are three
gray wolves, and two black bears. If you're in the area, stop by and
see
what's going on! p   p   b   span   p
