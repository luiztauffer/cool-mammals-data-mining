 p If you think of a wolf, you might imagine it living in a forest, maybe somewhere up north where it's pretty cold. That's one place where wolves can live, but wolves also live in all kinds of other places.   p 
 p An animal's  b habitat  b  is the type of place where the animal lives. Wolves can live in all different habitats including…   p 
 p Wolves once lived all over the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and South America. But people are afraid of wolves, so in places where a lot of people live, people hunted the wolves or forced them away. Today, wolves mostly live in places where there aren't a lot of people. That's why a lot of wolves today live in cold, empty places. The wolves are just looking for habitats without a lot of people.   p 
 p People killed wolves and forced them to leave the red areas on the map. But killing all the wolves actually caused other problems. For example, in many parts of the United States, wolves used to hunt and eat deer. With all the wolves gone, there were too many deer, and all the deer started destroying forests. Today, people are trying to bring wolves back to some of the habitats in red on the map, to bring back the balance of wolves and deer.   p 
 p Wolves can live in all different habitats, but the wolves have to change the way they live depending on their habitat.   p 
 p Wolves are  b carnivores  b , which means that they eat other animals to live. Wolves live in packs. Every wolf pack claims a certain amount of territory within its habitat, and hunts for food inside that territory. The members of the pack work together to hunt and kill much larger animals.   p

 p Wolf packs hunt and eat different things depending on what kind of habitat they live in. Depending on their habitat, they might eat deer, buffalo, caribou, beavers, mice, rabbits, squirrels, or other animals.   p 
 p A wolf's habitat also changes when it has its babies. Wolves that live further north have their babies in the late winter and early spring, around March to May. That way, the babies aren't exposed to the coldest days of winter while they're still young and small. Wolves that live further south have their babies earlier, because the winter isn't so bad.   p 
 p Wolves can live in many different types of  b habitat  b , including forests, deserts, and icy cold places. People once drove wolves away, but that caused other problems, so now people in some places are trying to bring the wolves back. The habitat where a wolf lives changes what kind of food the wolf can catch in its territory, and when the wolf has babies.  p
