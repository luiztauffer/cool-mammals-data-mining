Its close relatives include  a href=" wiki Guinea_pig" title="Guinea pig" guinea pigs  a  and  a href=" wiki Rock_cavy" title="Rock cavy" rock cavies  a , and it is more distantly related to the  a href=" wiki Agouti" title="Agouti" agouti  a , the  a href=" wiki Chinchilla" title="Chinchilla" chinchilla  a , and the  a href=" wiki Coypu" title="Coypu" coypu  a . The capybara inhabits  a href=" wiki Savanna" title="Savanna" savannas  a  and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species but it is hunted for its meat and  a href=" wiki Hide_(skin)" title="Hide (skin)" hide  a  and also for grease from its thick fatty  a href=" wiki Skin" title="Skin" skin  a , which is used in the pharmaceutical trade. sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-2" [2]  a   sup
