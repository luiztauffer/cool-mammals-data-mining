 p They may not look it, but capybara are excellent swimmers. Their eyes and ears sit high on their head so they can still see and hear what's going on while swimming.  p 
 p Capybara live near wetlands, rivers and lakes. Being able to swim provides a useful escape from predators like Jaguar, anaconda and birds of prey. They can stay submerged in water for up to 5 minutes.  p 
 p Capybara means "master of the grasses" - most of their diet is grass.  p 
 p Our capybara live with our squirrel monkeys in The Rainforest.  p
