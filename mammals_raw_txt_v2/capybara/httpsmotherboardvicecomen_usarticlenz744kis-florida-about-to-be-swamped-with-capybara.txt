 p Capybara are real damn cute. Look at this bugger. In fact, capybara are so endearing, that some people may have been importing them to own as pets.   p

 p This might explain why the 100-pound rodents, which are native to  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 10300 0" target="_blank" South America's marshlands  a , have been showing up in places where they don't belong. According to biologist  a href="http:  www.cookman.edu directory congdone index.html" target="_blank" Elizabeth Congdon  a , an assistant professor at Bethune-Cookman University, the state of Florida could have a serious capybara problem—and it might be the fault of exotic pet owners.   p 
 p For the last few decades, random capybara sightings  a href="http:  myfwc.com wildlifehabitats nonnatives mammals capybara " target="_blank" have been reported  a  to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission by befuddled Florida residents. In 2001, several critters were said to have escaped a captive herd near Alachua. That same year, one was killed on Interstate 10. Others  a href="http:  www.wildflorida.com articles Wild_Capybara_return_to_Florida.php" target="_blank" have seen them feeding  a  along the banks of local rivers.   p 
 p Up until now, there's been no concrete evidence that Florida's capybara have been breeding, even though the feral animals had to have been coming from  i somewhere  i . Their origin story is actually  a href="http:  www.orlandoweekly.com Blogs archives 2016 08 16 florida-now-has-a-capybara-problem" target="_blank" a bit of a mystery  a , involving rumors of capybara being released by pet owners, sneaking out of zoos, or even fleeing research facilities. Since sightings have been sporadic, biologists haven't been able to tell whether the animal has become an  a href="https:  www.nwf.org Wildlife Threats-to-Wildlife Invasive-Species.aspx" target="_blank" established invasive species  a , meaning a threat to native wildlife.   p 
 p This video is relaxing.   p 
 p However, in a presentation at the  a href="http:  www.animalbehaviorsociety.org 2016 " target="_blank" 53rd Annual Conference of the Animal Behavior Society  a , this is exactly what Congdon said might be occurring. Based on a known population of around 50 capybara in northern Florida, Congdon believes the species could be thriving and dispersing throughout the state's waterways. In order to understand what effects they might be having on flora and fauna, she also announced that she'll be  a href="http:  www.animalbehaviorsociety.org abs_online core_routines view_abstract_no.php?show_close_window=yes&amp;abstractno=471" target="_blank" conducting a systemic review  a  of the aquatic rodents.   p 
 p "Capybaras have been introduced to northern Florida. Several sightings suggest they have been breeding,"  a href="http:  www.redorbit.com news science 1113415441 capybara-invasive-speies-081516 " target="_blank" Congdon told Red Orbit  a . "They might be able to make a go of it in the United States."   p 
 p Florida is no stranger to the catastrophic capabilities of invasive species. Experts estimate that 500 types of non-native fish and wildlife  a href="http:  myfwc.com wildlifehabitats nonnatives " target="_blank" roam the state  a , though not all of them are considered harmful. Many of these invaders entered Florida legally through the exotic pet trade, and one way or another, crept into native ecosystems. Earlier this year, I wrote about Florida's Burmese pythons, which are so prolific and threatening that biologists  a href="http:  motherboard.vice.com read why-snakes-biggest-defenders-are-in-favor-of-killing-them" now host annual culling festivals  a  to spread awareness about their presence.   p 
 p Still, when it comes to invasive animals—especially those often kept as pets—humans aren't always willing to do what's best for the environment, according to science. After I covered Florida's Burmese python cull, I received a slew of emails from passionate snake owners, condemning the event for being unnecessarily cruel. While these critics couldn't provide evidence that pythons weren't wreaking havoc on Florida's ecosystems ( a href="https:  www.nps.gov ever learn nature burmesepythonsintro.htm" target="_blank" they are  a ), they were certain that killing them was the wrong answer.   p 
 p class="article__image-caption" Here's what a nutria looks like. Image: Flickr  a href="https:  www.flickr.com photos blmurch 2373199856" target="_blank" Beatrice Murch  a    p 
 p Congdon suspects that capybara could mirror North America's invasive nutria— a href="https:  www.aphis.usda.gov publications wildlife_damage content printable_version fs_nutria10.pdf" target="_blank" a semiaquatic rodent  a  that caused extensive damage to marshes and wetlands. The species was first introduced for the fur trade in the late 19th century, and has persisted ever since. Like the nutria, it's possible that Florida's capybara could  a href="http:  www.invasivespecies.wa.gov priorities nutria.shtml" target="_blank" ravage aquatic ecosystems  a  by overgrazing, and disrupt the marshy areas along riverbanks. If capybara are free from natural predators, they could also displace native wildlife that occupy similar ecological niches.   p 
 p Capybara  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 10300 0" target="_blank" aren't endangered  a  in their native South American habitat, but they are extremely vulnerable to over-hunting, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. In some regions, capybara have been effectively wiped out for their meat and skin.   p 
 p Still, without any evidence of their invasive effects, there's no need to panic over Florida's capybara yet. But if you see one roaming the swampland, you should definitely  a href="http:  myfwc.com wildlifehabitats nonnatives reporting-hotline " target="_blank" contact a local biologist  a . Hopefully, in the near future, we'll be able to learn some fascinating things about the world's largest rodent.   p 
 p "We want to keep them from spreading,"  a href="http:  www.redorbit.com news science 1113415441 capybara-invasive-speies-081516 " target="_blank" Congdon added  a , "but can we please not kill them all so I can study them?"   p 
 p I somehow suspect that won't be a problem.   p
