The largest rodents in the world, these wild animals are found only in South America. With thick, reddish to dark brown fur, they can weigh up to 90 kilos and reach 1.2 meters in length and 60 centimeters tall. There are between 50 and 100 individuals there, many of them puppies, which can be seen grazing along the banks of water courses that cut through the site. It is a scene employees are used to, but it is a surprise for visitors.  p 
 p name="43fb" id="43fb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" The reason for the existence of wild animals in the area is simple: 20% of the total property area of ​​13,270,000 m2 has been given over to the protection of native forest (2,654,000 m2 of legal reserve area). It is an immense protected area, including an ecological corridor of tropical vegetation along the Atibaia River and the rivers that dissect the site, which allows the movement of animals around the company’s property and neighboring areas. Other animals, such as maned wolves, armadillos, cotias, monkeys and even cougars, are also living there. Less timid than other species, capybaras make up the overwhelming majority.  p 
 p name="5507" id="5507" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" But how can we guarantee harmonious coexistence between the Solvay plants in Paulínia and local fauna and flora? The answer is with careful  a href="https:  www.solvay.com en company sustainability index.html" data-href="https:  www.solvay.com en company sustainability index.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" Health, Safety and Environment  a  (HSE) practices that ensure both the welfare of the animals and the safety of people and the industrial facilities.  p

 p name="db37" id="db37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" To prevent animals from getting into risky areas, wire fences have been put up on the south side of the unit and protective barriers have been installed around the fire-fighting water tanks. “ em class="markup--em markup--p-em" In addition, our access control and constant vigilance on the property keep hunters away .The capybaras are protected within our limits  em ,” says Alexandre Toledo, environment manager at the site.  p 
 p name="8bc6" id="8bc6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" Human health is also in focus. Capybaras carry ticks that can transmit an infectious disease known as  a href="https:  www.cdc.gov rmsf index.html" data-href="https:  www.cdc.gov rmsf index.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" Rocky Mountain spotted fever  a . So, all the pastures the animals use are flagged, alerting people to the risk. Educational campaigns are also ongoing. “ em class="markup--em markup--p-em" If an employee or third party needs to work in one of these areas, they are given special clothing — white overalls that help identify any infestation. Adhesive tapes seal the clothing, preventing ticks from getting in  em ,” explains Alexandre. However, he says the fact that these ticks are on the animals does not mean disease will be spread. They need to be infected by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii.  p
