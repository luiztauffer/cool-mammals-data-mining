 p Adelaide Zoo is home to the world’s largest rodent, the capybara. Dalia and Sofia were born on 27 August 2012 at San Diego Zoo. The duo arrived at Adelaide Zoo in October 2013. Between them, these two sisters have given birth to more than 30 pups! This gorgeous pair can be hand-fed and enjoy a good scratch from zoo keepers, especially when they are treated with their favourites – broccoli and bamboo!  p 
 p Capybaras are semi-aquatic mammals found throughout South America. They live in densely forested areas near bodies of water.  p 
 p The capybara is the largest of all the 1,729 species of living rodents. They’re closely related to guinea pigs and have excellent aquatic skills. Their webbed feet, thick fur and high position of the eyes, ears and nose on their head make them great swimmers. They can even hold their breath for up to five minutes underwater to hide from predators like jaguars and pumas!  p 
 p Capybaras are a highly social species and live in groups of around 10 to 20 individuals. Mothers are known to care for each other’s offspring and pups are known to feed from any mother within the group.  p 
 p Although the wild capybara population is not considered threatened, in some areas hunting has reduced their numbers.  p 
 p  strong Love capybaras? There are many ways you can help support these quirky creatures.  strong   p
