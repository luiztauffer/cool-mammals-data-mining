 p Capybaras share similar features with guinea pigs, such as their ever-growing front teeth, but also have partially webbed feet, which means they are excellent swimmers. They are herbivorous, eating mostly grass, water plants and vegetables, as well as fruit and tree bark.  p 
 p Capybaras are not endangered, though their population has been affected by hunting and habitat loss. Capybara are native to Central and South America with many other animals sharing nearby habitats, such as the Golden Lion Tamarin and the Cotton-Top Tamarin, which are listed as endangered and critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.  p
