 p As much of a problem as it is when a species becomes endangered, there can also be a problem when an area becomes overpopulated with a certain kind of animal as well. This is especially true when the species is out of its natural habitat.  p 
 p Florida is seeing this situation first hand, as a rodent population that is non-native to the state has been steadily growing. The effects could be devastating if not properly studied and taken care of!  p 
 p class="btcaption" style="text-align: center;"  strong Capybara are a species of rodent native to the marshlands of South America. At 100 pounds, they’re the largest rodents on Earth, but they’re also pretty cute, which is why some people have taken them in as pets.   strong   p

 p class="btcaption" style="text-align: center;"  strong This wouldn’t be the first time that Florida sees a non-native species harm to the local ecosystem. The state is home to over 500 non-native fish and other wildlife, largely – and, quite often, legally – thanks to the exotic pet trade. Yet even if these animals are acquired by humans through legal means, that doesn’t mean they can’t do serious damage when they find their ways into the local ecosystem.  strong   p

 p style="text-align: center;" Congdon doesn’t believe that such extreme measures should be taken in order to solve Capybara problem, even though it’s possible that they can cause an overgrazing issue, among other potential threats that arise when a non-native species is introduced to an ecosystem.  p 
 p class="btcaption" style="text-align: center;"  strong However, this could also be an opportunity to learn more about these fascinating creatures. Get in touch with a local biologist if you see one running around a swamp.   strong   p 
 p style="text-align: center;" “We want to keep them from spreading,” says Congdon, “but can we please not kill them all so I can study them?”  p 
 p As much as you may love a particular animal, exotic pets are generally ill-advised for a number of reasons. While it may be too early to panic about Florida’s growing capybara population just yet, all of this trouble could have been avoided if these rodents were just kept in their natural habitats!  p
