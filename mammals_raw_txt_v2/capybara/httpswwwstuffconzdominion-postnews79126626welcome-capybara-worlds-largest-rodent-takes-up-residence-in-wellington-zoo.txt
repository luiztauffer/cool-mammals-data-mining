 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  Wellington Zoo will celebrate 110 years this school holidays with a brand new animal – the world's largest rodent.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  The four new capybara are related to the cute and cuddly guinea pigs found in many New Zealand back yards and houses, but can grow to about two feet tall and weigh about 70kg.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  They have arrived in the capital from Parc Zoologique de Paris this week and will be housed in a redeveloped habitat near the zoo entrance that will have two water holes and the shelters needed for the semi-aquatic animal.   p

 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  "We're very excited to have the capybaras join us," the zoo's life sciences manager Dave French said.   p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  "This is a great opportunity to come to the zoo these school holidays and learn all about these charismatic animals and how we can prevent help to protect their natural habitat."  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  Many may know the animal because of popular Tumblr blog  em  a href="http:  animalssittingoncapybaras.tumblr.com " Animals Sitting on Capybaras  a ,   em which demonstrates why they are sometimes referred to as nature's lounge chairs.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  Native to Central and northern South America, the capybara is distantly related to agoutis, which are also at Wellington Zoo, eat grass and aquatic plants, have webbed feet and can hold their breath under water for five minutes.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  The one male and three female would be easy to tell apart because the male had a scent gland on his nose called a morillo, French said.   p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  "This bump is used as a way of sending out a chemical signal, particularly during breeding season."  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  They are not endangered, but the populations have been affected by hunting and habitat loss.   p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"    The arrival of the new animals will be a day of celebration  after the recent deaths of chimpanzee Sam and pelican Lanky.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  The zoo turns 110 this week and will celebrate throughout the year, including giving free entry to the 110th visitor each day and a Trade Me auction for a '110 reasons to love Wellington Zoo' experience, that will include 30 minutes with a cheetah and a behind-the scenes tour.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"  Chief executive Karen Fifield said the free entry was a way to thank the community for its support.  p 
 p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph"   "Wellington Zoo is at the forefront of best practice animal care, sustainability and conservation, and we will continue to do so over the next 110 years."  p
