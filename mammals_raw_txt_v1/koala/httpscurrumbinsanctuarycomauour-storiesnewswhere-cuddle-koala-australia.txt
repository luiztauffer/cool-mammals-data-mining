 p The koala is a much-loved symbol of Australia that’s instantly recognised by locals and tourists alike – and there’s only once place on earth you’ll find these uniquely adorable tree-dwellers: the great down under. If you’re mapping out your visit to the mainland, a  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au what-to-see-and-do encounters koala-experience" koala cuddle experience  a  is a touring milestone for all travellers and holidaymakers.  p 
 p Nothing beats getting up close and personal with our Aussie natives, but  u only select areas in the country  u  allow visitors the privilege to hold a koala. Aimed at educating visitors on conservation efforts, these very special encounters are strictly monitored to ensure the utmost wellbeing of those tree-hugging residents.   p 
 p  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au" Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary  a  has been a favourite among Queenslanders and tourists for some time – but what else do we know about the humble koala?  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p Though often referred to as “koala bears” – these herbivorous national icons aren’t actually related to the latter.  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au what-to-see-and-do animals koala" Koalas  a  are in fact,  u marsupials  u , whose young (called joeys) are carried within their abdominal pouch. Koala joeys are blind and hairless during their stay in mum’s pouch, where they remain out-of-sight until they are old enough (between 7 and 8 months) to ride on her back. sup 1  sup   p 
 p Koalas will spend the majority of their day dozing in the comfort and safety of their home trees – while slow-moving waking hours are occupied by eating their favourite moisture-rich eucalyptus leaves.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p Koalas sure love their sleep, but these beloved marsupials might soon be waking up to a grave future – that’s because  u koalas are currently listed as a vulnerable species  u  in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.   p 
 p Koala populations have been hit hard by  u devastating diseases  u  such as chlamydia and koala retrovirus. Of the 400 yearly admissions to the wildlife hospital, around 80% of those koalas are affected by disease. That’s why the Sanctuary is working hard with The University of Queensland, University of the Sunshine Coast and the City of Gold Coast to develop a koala chlamydial vaccine – but a boost to  u funding is desperately needed  u  to safeguard further research.  p 
 p But our Aussie wildlife populations are also being placed under enormous pressure as human activities merge into natural ecosystems. The story behind what many consider to be a national shame lies high up in the forks of gum trees, where  u vanishing habitats, dog attacks and busy roads  u  have left a species in decline. sup 2  sup  Australia’s densely populated east coast is where their eucalyptus home trees flourish – and so koalas are essentially competing with humans as land clearing makes way for development.  p

 p Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary is  u no ordinary zoo  u . It serves as a haven to rescued native mammals, reptiles, birdlife and amphibians – and none other than the much-loved koala. Strong support from visitors has allowed the park and its magnificent residents to thrive for generations – and continued public education efforts have provided the Sanctuary with some  u vital breeding and conservation programs  u .  p 
 p    p 
 p You’ll have the opportunity to  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au what-to-see-and-do encounters koala-experience" meet some of our koala families  a  within their well-mimicked native surrounds – and more importantly, learn about their features, habitat, reproduction, and fussy food preferences. What better way to fulfil your Aussie itinerary, than by supporting a vulnerable species. To top off your experience, one of our professional photographers will  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au what-to-see-and-do encounters koala_Photo" capture your adorable cuddle  a  so you can cherish your memory for life.  p 
 p Or perhaps you’d rather make like a koala and climb the gumtrees by taking on the in-park  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au what-to-see-and-do encounters treetop-challenge" TreeTop Challenge  a , for a bird’s eye view of the Sanctuary and all the animals.  p 
 p    p 
 p What’s more is this treasured Sanctuary is one of the few wildlife parks where you can visit an in-park community hospital free-of-charge and witness an amazing team of veterinary surgeons save the lives of sick and injured animals. The  a href="https:  currumbinsanctuary.com.au what-to-see-and-do wildlife-hospital" Currumbin Wildlife Hospital  a  has grown into one of the busiest wildlife hospitals in the world, with over 10,000 animal admissions every year – including over 400 wild koalas.  p 
 p These beautiful animals deserve a brighter future. You can contribute even further by  a href="http:  cwhf.org.au get-involved tree-to-me " donating to our Tree to Me Program  a  today.  p
