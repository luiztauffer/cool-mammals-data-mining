 p class="" In an Australian gum-tree forest, a furry gray animal is taking a nap. It's a koala, and the branches of the gum trees are where the little marsupial makes its home, high above the ground. Filled with information perfectly suited to the abilities and interests of its second-grade audience, this colorful, fact-filled volume introduces young readers to the everyday life of a koala. How is the koala's body adapted to its treetop life? What does the koala eat? How does it move from tree to tree? And how does a female koala keep her tiny joey safe while climbing from tree to tree? Throughout the book, readers are encouraged to make scientific observations based on the book's images and answer questions about koalas' lives and physical characteristics. This innovative approach to teaching about wild animals gives young scientists the chance not only to read and learn the facts, but also to develop their own powers of observation and critical thinking.  p
