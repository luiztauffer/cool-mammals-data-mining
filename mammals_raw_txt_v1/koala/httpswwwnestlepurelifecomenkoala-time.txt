 p class="text-align-center" Here are five  em kool  em -ala reasons why these cute critters are one of our water heroes.  p 
 p Koalas have developed a clever trick for staying hydrated. Unlike humans—who (duh!) need to  em drink  em  water—koalas get most of their moisture by eating juicy eucalyptus leaves that make up most of their diet.  p 
 p They might look soft and cuddly, but koalas actually have rough coats. Their coarse and wiry fur is waterproof and keeps them warm and dry.  p 
 p Koalas live in Australia, one of the driest countries in the world.  p 
 p During extreme heat or drought, which can affect these critters’ food source, they’ll occasionally come down from trees to find water.  p 
 p A koala baby—called a joey—stops drinking its mother’s milk when it’s about six or seven months old. The joey then munches on eucalyptus leaves, just like Mom.  p 
 p These cute critters have odd dinner hours. They usually sleep during the day and munch at night. That’s when the weather cools down, which helps the koala conserve moisture. strong    strong   p
