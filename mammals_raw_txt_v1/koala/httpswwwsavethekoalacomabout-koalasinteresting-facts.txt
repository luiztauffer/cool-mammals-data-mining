 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - The AKF estimates that there are likely to be  strong less than 80,000  strong  Koalas remaining in Australia today and it could be as low as  strong 43,000  strong . Much of their habitat has already been lost. This makes it vitally important to save what is left.  p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - Koalas are mostly  strong nocturnal  strong . Nocturnal animals are awake at night and asleep during the day. Koalas, however, sleep for part of the night and also sometimes move about in the daytime. They often sleep for  strong up to 18-20 hours each day  strong .  p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - An adult koala eats about 1 2 - 1 kilogram of leaves each night.  p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - There is a myth that Koalas sleep a lot because they  strong ‘get drunk’   strong on gumleaves. Fortunately, this is  strong not correct!   strong Most of their time is spent sleeping because it requires a lot of energy to digest their t strong oxic, fibrous, low-nutrition diet  strong  and sleeping is the best way to conserve energy  p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - Koalas in the southern parts of Australia ( strong left)  strong  are considerably larger and have thicker fur than those in the north  strong (right).  strong  span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px; background-color: initial;" This is thought to be an adaptation to keep them warm in the colder southern winters.  span   p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - Each Koala’s ‘home' is made up of several trees called  strong HOME TREES  strong . They visit these same trees regularly. The area covered by these trees is called the Koala’s  strong HOME RANGE  strong . Each Koala has its own home range, which overlaps those of other Koalas. Unless breeding, they don’t normally visit another Koalas home trees. The size of each home range depends upon a range of factors including the  strong quality of the habitat and the sex, age and social position  strong  in the population of the Koala.  p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - When the Joey is born, it’s only about  strong 2 centimetres long  strong , is blind and furless and its ears are not yet developed. On its amazing journey to the pouch, it relies on its well-developed senses of  strong smell  strong  and  strong touch,  strong  its strong forelimbs and claws, and an inborn sense of direction. Once in the pouch, it attaches itself to one of the two teats which swells in its mouth, preventing it from being dislodged from its source of food.   p

 p class="rteindent1"    p 
 p class="rteindent1" - The Joey stays in its mother’s pouch for about  strong 6 or 7 months  strong , drinking only milk. Before it can tolerate gumleaves, which are toxic for most mammals, the joey must feed on a substance called  strong ‘pap'  strong  which is a specialised form of the mother’s droppings that is soft and runny. This allows the mother to pass on to the joey special micro-organisms from her intestine which are necessary for it to be able to digest the gumleaves. It feeds on this for a period of up to a few weeks, just prior to it coming out of the pouch at about 6 or 7 months of age.   p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;"    p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - After venturing out of the pouch, the Joey rides on its mother’s abdomen or back, although it continues to return to her pouch for milk until it is too big to fit inside. The joey leaves its mother’s home range between  strong 1 and 3 years old  strong , depending on when the mother has her next joey.

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" -  strong Female   strong Koalas are fully mature by about  strong 2 years   strong of age and  strong males  strong  by their t strong hird or fourth year  strong . By this time they need to have found their own home range, either in a home range left vacant by a dead Koala or in a new area of the forest. This is one reason why Koalas need quite large areas of habitat.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;"    p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - Koalas do not live in rainforests or desert areas. They live in the t strong all eucalypt forests and low eucalypt woodlands  strong  of mainland eastern Australia, and on some islands off the southern and eastern coasts.  strong Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia  strong  are the only states where Koalas are found naturally in the wild.  p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;"  span style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;" - The Australian Koala Foundation believes that the Australian Government should be responsible for the protection of all Koala habitat on private land. The current fragmented approach of each State being responsible for its own Koalas   span  strong style="line-height: 19.2000007629395px;" is not working.   strong   p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;"    p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - There are well over  strong 7  strong  strong 00 varieties of eucalypts  strong . Koalas eat only some of these. They are very fussy eaters and have strong preferences for different types of gum leaves. Within a particular area, as few as one, and generally no more than two or three species of eucalypt will be regularly browsed (we call these 'primary browse trees') while a variety of other species, including some non-eucalypts, appear to be browsed occasionally or used for just sitting or sleeping in.  p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - A forest can only have a certain number of Koalas living in it. This is called the forest’s ‘ strong carrying capacity'  strong . Like pasture for sheep, the available gumtrees can only feed a certain number of Koalas.   p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - An adult Koala eats about  strong half a kilogram to one kilogram of leaves each night  strong , depending on many factors, including the size and sex of the koala and where the Koala lives.  p

 p style="margin-left: 36pt;"    p 
 p style="margin-left: 36pt;" - Koalas have an unusual fibre-digesting organ called a strong  caecum.  strong  Other mammals, including humans, also have a caecum, but the Koala's is very long (200 cms) and it has a blind end. It contains millions of bacteria which break down the fibre into substances which are easier to absorb. Even so, the Koala is still only able to absorb  strong 25% of fibre eaten  strong , hence their need to eat large amounts of leaves.  p

 p class="rteindent1" -  strong Chlamydia  strong  is an organism which lives in the body tissues of most healthy Koalas. In normal populations, we believe that chlamydia may act as an inbuilt control mechanism to limit the population so that the trees are not overbrowsed, ensuring that only the strongest and fittest animals survive to breed.  p
