 p As one of China's national emblems, giant pandas are the most widely used animal in its diplomatic activities. Panda diplomacy got started in the late 1950s when China sent two pandas to the Moscow Zoo as a symbol of the close ties between China and the Soviet Union. Two months after US president Richard Nixon's historic visit to China in February 1972, giant pandas Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling were sent to Washington as gifts.  p 
 p In 1982, China stopped presenting pandas as gifts because of the dwindling number of the animals in the country. Instead, pandas were given as renewable loans for perio a href="http:  topic.chinadaily.com.cn index special sid 679" ds  a  of 10 years.  p
