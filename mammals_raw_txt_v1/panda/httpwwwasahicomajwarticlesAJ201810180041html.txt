 p Giant pandas could melt most hearts, and they seem to be effective in warming diplomatic relations, too.  p 
 p Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will request China to loan more of the lovable animals to Japanese zoos when he meets with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on Oct. 26, sources said.  p 
 p After their meeting, talks between the two countries are expected to go into detail about such an agreement, including the loan period and number of pandas Japan can borrow.  p 
 p Chinese officials have already conveyed to their Japanese counterparts at working-level meetings that they agree with the idea, in principle, according to the sources.  p 
 p “That China is positively considering the loan of pandas to Japan demonstrates that the leadership led by President Xi Jinping is serious about improving relations with Japan,” a Japanese government official said.  p 
 p If Japan’s request is granted, it will be the first loan of its kind since a pair, Shin Shin and Ri Ri, arrived at Tokyo’s Ueno Zoo in February 2011.  p 
 p Oji Zoo in Kobe and Sendai Yagiyama Zoological Park in Sendai are possible hosts to new pandas, but only one zoo could receive the animals depending on the number provided to Japan, according to the sources.  p 
 p The idea has been floated that the official agreement on China’s loaning of new pandas could be made during Xi’s planned visit to Japan next year.  p 
 p China uses its pandas as a tool to enhance diplomatic relations with other countries.  p 
 p Beijing presented two pandas to Tokyo when they normalized ties in 1972.  p
