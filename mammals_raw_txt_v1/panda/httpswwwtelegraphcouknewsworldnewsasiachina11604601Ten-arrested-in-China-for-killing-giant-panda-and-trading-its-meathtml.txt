 p  Ten people have been detained in  a target="_blank" href="https:  www.telegraph.co.uk news worldnews asia china " China  a  on suspicion of killing a giant panda and trading its meat and fur, state media said on Wednesday.   p 
 p  Police in southwest China made the arrests after seizing a panda's pelt, skull and bones along with its butchered meat in a raid in March, according to China Central Television.   p 
 p  Regarded as a national treasure, pandas are a protected species in China and the poaching of the animal and trafficking of its parts is both illegal and rare.   p 
 p  According to Yunnan's forestry administration, the adult female panda was shot when two brothers surnamed Wang went hunting for a predator that had killed their sheep.   p 
 p  "Only after he shot what he described as a 'big animal' did Wang realise it was a panda," says a report in China Daily, a state-run newspaper. When the injured panda climbed a tree, the brothers shot it again.   p 
 p  The brothers later butchered the animal and sold 35kg of panda meat and four paws for 4,800 yuan (£490) to a buyer on the black market.   p 
 p  Hunting pandas in China carries "at least" a 10-year prison sentence and the confiscation of property. Under "grave circumstances" a life sentence or even a death sentence may be meted out, according to the law protecting pandas that was passed in 1987.   p

 p  The news has enraged Chinese internet users. "So heartless!" wrote one user, KNa6688, on Sina Weibo. "[Pandas] are listed as national treasures, but they are still hunted. Is the 4,800 yuan worth the cost of a panda's life and 10 years in prison?"   p 
 p  Giant pandas are categorised as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.   p 
 p  Wild pandas were thought to only live in China's Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Following the shooting in Yunnan province, authorities have said they will try to establish whether other pandas are living in the area.   p 
 p  China has gone to great efforts to protect its panda population. A survey by the Chinese government in February found the number of animals in the wild has  a target="_blank" href="https:  www.telegraph.co.uk news worldnews asia china 11441960 Chinas-panda-population-increases-by-17-per-cent-major-census-finds.html" increased by nearly 17 per cent over the last decade  a .
