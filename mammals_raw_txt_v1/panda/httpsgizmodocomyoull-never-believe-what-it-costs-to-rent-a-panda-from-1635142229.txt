 p China owns all the pandas. If you've got some pandas at your local zoo, they're probably on loan. Moving animals around for breeding is common, but for-profit rental at this scale may be unique to the bamboo-munching bears.  p

 p The pandas are rented from the Chinese government for 10 years and  the contract stipulates that Edinburgh must pay £600,000 a year for the  pair. Any cub that is born must be returned to China after two years.  Should one die because of human error, it is understood that the zoo  must pay £300,000.  p 
 p class="ad-label proxima"  small class="proxima" Advertisement  small   p 
 p £600,000 is equivalent to some 947 thousand US Dollars. That's nearly $10 million over a decade, not including the costs of their care and feeding:  p 
 p But that is just the start. The [Edinburgh] zoo had to  spend nearly £300,000 to house its pandas and has now been hit by rising  bamboo costs. When the pair arrived in 2011, it cost around £70,000 a  year to import fresh shoots from France, but this has risen to £100,000,  said [the zoo's Director of Pandas, Iain] Valentine. To offset the costs, the zoo has now planted 3,000  clumps.  p 
 p Having a panda can be ruinous, say some zoos, and could  even take money away from other conservation work. Washington, Atlanta,  Memphis and San Diego zoos are said to have spent $33m more on pandas  from 2000-03 than they received from showing them.  p 
 p class="ad-label proxima"  small class="proxima" Advertisement  small   p 
 p And it isn't just that the prices are exorbitant. Vidal writes that China seems to be using panda loans as geopolitical tools. That's not new, of course. The donation of a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington DC, at least in part, helped to calm frayed nerves during the Cold War. But what's new is leveraging them as tools for international trade.  p 
 p But  a href="http:  www.wri.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http:  www.wri.org', {metric25:1})" World Resources Institute   a researcher Kathleen Buckingham, with a team at Oxford University, last year studied China's recent panda loans  a href="http:  www.ox.ac.uk media news_stories 2013 130925_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http:  www.ox.ac.uk media news_stories 2013 130925_2.html', {metric25:1})" and concluded that all were linked to trade.  a   p 
 p The  Edinburgh deal, overseen by China's vice-premier, Li Keqiang, coincided  with a £2.6bn contract for Britain to supply China with petrochemical  and renewable energy technologies, Jaguar cars and  a href="http:  www.theguardian.com politics 2011 feb 20 scotland-salmon-threat-china-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http:  www.theguardian.com politics 2011 feb 20 scotland-salmon-threat-china-deal', {metric25:1})" enough salmon to double Scotland's production.  a   p 
 p Other  panda pairs were loaned to Canadian and Australian zoos after  negotiations for uranium, oil and minerals. Singapore, Malaysia,  Thailand and Macao all got pandas after signing free-trade agreements. In  France, the panda loan to Beauval zoo coincided with a  a href="http:  money.cnn.com 2013 10 14 news economy china-panda-trade " target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="window.ga('send', 'event', 'Embedded Url', 'External link', 'http:  money.cnn.com 2013 10 14 news economy china-panda-trade ', {metric25:1})" $20bn deal for nuclear giant Areva to supply China with uranium oxide.  a   p 
 p "A  new phase of panda diplomacy is under way. Panda loans are associated  with nations supplying China with valuable resources and symbolise  China's willingness to build trade relationships," said Buckingham.  p

But the emerging understanding of pandanomics raises several important questions.   p 
 p Should the charismatic, notoriously finnicky bears be used as political chesspieces? What trade-offs are acceptable when it comes to advancing the conservation of an endangered species? Is working towards panda conservation a suitable goal if it means shuttling oil and gas across the globe? And just what impact has our society's collective obsession with the furry critters actually had?  p
