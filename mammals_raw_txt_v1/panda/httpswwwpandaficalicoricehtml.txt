 p class="lead" Licorice has been believed to possess curative, even mystical powers. Licorice has in the past been used to protect against evil spirits, and it has served as a remedy for stomach pains, cough and lung infections. Today fortunately you can get licorice from the shelves of stores, without the need of pretending to be ill.  p 
 p The main raw material is of course licorice root. Licorice is a plant that grows wild on the mountain slopes in southern Europe and Asia. Licorice root is processed onto licorice extract. Other basic ingredients are wheat flour, syrup and anise.  p 
 p The famous, wonderfully soft Panda licorice is prepared by a conventional cooking method, in which the raw materials are boiled onto dough and then compressed into their form in accordance with the licorice master Väinö Hilden’s legacy recipe.  p 
 p Licorice production began in 1927 in Vaajakoski, central Finland. And to this day, Panda’s licorice has reached the market leader position in licorice products.  p
