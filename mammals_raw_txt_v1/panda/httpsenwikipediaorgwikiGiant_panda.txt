 p Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements. sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-65" [65]  a   sup

 p Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits and analyzed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas and during breeding season the pandas would trek back down to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium. sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-66" [66]  a   sup

The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the  a href=" wiki Cultural_Revolution" title="Cultural Revolution" Cultural Revolution  a , all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the  a href=" wiki Chinese_economic_reform" title="Chinese economic reform" Chinese economic reform  a , demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the  a href=" wiki Underground_economy" class="mw-redirect" title="Underground economy" black market  a , acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.
  p 
 p Though the  a href=" wiki Wolong_National_Nature_Reserve" title="Wolong National Nature Reserve" Wolong National Nature Reserve  a  was set up by the PRC government in 1958 to save the declining panda population, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a  a href=" wiki Rare_species" title="Rare species" rare species  a .

 p In 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000.
