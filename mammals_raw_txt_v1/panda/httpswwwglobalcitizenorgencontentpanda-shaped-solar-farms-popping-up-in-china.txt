 p As the country‚Äôs national animal, pandas are everywhere in China. They appear on fuzzy slippers, crackers, and coins.  p 
 p And now, the beloved bear will make an appearance in a new field, quite literally: solar energy farms.  p 
 p The Chinese energy company Panda Green Energy Group is building  a href="http:  www.businessinsider.com r-paw-power-china-plans-100-panda-shaped-solar-plants-on-new-silk-road-2017-7" 100 panda-shaped solar energy farms  a  across the country. From above, ¬†the assortment of panels will look like a cartoon panda smiling up at the sky.  p

 p The group has a href="http:  www.businessinsider.com r-paw-power-china-plans-100-panda-shaped-solar-plants-on-new-silk-road-2017-7"  already build one  a  in Datong, Shanxi province and is currently working on another. Still, one-fourth of China‚Äôs coal reserves come from Shanxi, making the northern province a key area for the country‚Äôs energy infrastructure.  p 
 p The first farm in Shanxi spans  a href="https:  www.forbes.com sites trevornace 2017 07 25 china-just-built-250-acre-solar-farm-shaped-giant-panda " 250 acres  a  and produces 50 MW of solar energy. Once completed, the two 50 MW solar farms in the province will supply enough energy to power  a href="http:  www.businessinsider.com r-paw-power-china-plans-100-panda-shaped-solar-plants-on-new-silk-road-2017-7" 10,000 houses annually  a .  p 
 p According to Panda Green Energy Group, one panda-shaped solar farm will prevent the equivalent of  a href="http:  www.businessinsider.com r-paw-power-china-plans-100-panda-shaped-solar-plants-on-new-silk-road-2017-7" 1.06 million tons of coal from being burned and 2.75 million tons of greenhouse gas being emitted  a  in the next 25 years.  p 
 p China is not alone in building adorable solar farms. The island nation of Fiji  a href="https:  www.forbes.com sites trevornace 2017 07 25 china-just-built-250-acre-solar-farm-shaped-giant-panda " announced  a  its plan in May to build a panda-shaped solar farm.  p

More recently, the country has put together a PR campaign to show China as a leader in renewable energy production.  p
