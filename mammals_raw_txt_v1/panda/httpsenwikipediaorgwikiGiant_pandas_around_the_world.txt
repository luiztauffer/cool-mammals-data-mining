Finland received its first two pandas in January 2018. These zoos have contracts with China to house these pandas for a few years. Giant pandas are on the  a href=" wiki IUCN_Red_List" title="IUCN Red List" IUCN Red List  a  so part of the reason these contracts exist between China and international zoos is to try to help the species reproduce before they are brought back to their native land. For this reason, pandas are treated very well. sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-1" [1]  a   sup

 p Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the pandas that are housed in the  a href=" wiki Edinburgh_Zoo" title="Edinburgh Zoo" Edinburgh Zoo  a  in Scotland. They live in  275,000 pounds suites and have organic food flown in from the Continent. They are on loan from China and will return in 2021. “Tian Tian and Yang Guang have been put in enclosures designed by animal psychologists, which come complete with dens, private pools, a viewing platform and a room where the pandas will be given health check-ups.”
In their new habitats, each panda has a climbing frame that will enable them to see each other over the tops of their enclosures. The design of the habitat is to resemble their natural habitat in the wild. They have caves to sleep in and rocks where they can lay and do their favorite pastime, munch on bamboo. sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-2" [2]  a   sup

They were named after the snowstorm that prevailed at the time they arrived in Finland.

 p  a href=" wiki Adelaide_Zoo" title="Adelaide Zoo" Adelaide Zoo  a  in Australia houses two pandas, Wang Wang and Funi, who were earlier rescued from China. They were donated to Australia in 2009. They live together as male and female but also live with six red pandas. The space was created to provide comfort for the pandas but to not have the exhibit so big that the panda species would not be able to interact. In each inside room there is “deep litter” which is a type of mulch to provide a clean inside for the pandas to live in. sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-9" [9]  a   sup   sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-10" [10]  a   sup

 p The landscape of the exhibit was designed to mirror the native home of the two pandas, China. The giant panda exhibit is over 3,000 square metres and gives the pandas the options such as moving outside to lay on cool rocks or to bath in waterfalls. The two pandas that the Adelaide Zoo in Australia holds also have the option of staying inside in either air conditioned rooms or in more natural caves to provide comfort for the pandas. The exhibit also has new 24-hour closed circuit television to observe the pandas and how they interact with one another as well as other species in the exhibit. There is also a public viewing terrace under a bamboo canopy to accommodate the crowds but also to manage the privacy of the pandas. The zoo has specialist keepers just for the pandas as well as vets on hand at the zoo to make sure the pandas are well taken care of and protected. sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-11" [11]  a   sup

 p In Asian Zoos, a diet of mostly gruel and bread is fed to pandas. In an experiment on how nutritious the pandas' diet in Chinese zoos is, two 5 day feeding trials were conducted. The pandas were both different age. The younger panda ate more  a href=" wiki Bamboo" title="Bamboo" bamboo  a  than the older panda did. Gruel, however, can cause problems for the panda’s digestive system. The diets of pandas in captivity do not consist of enough bamboo, which can be harmful to their wellbeing. sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-12" [12]  a   sup

Factors that contribute to the chemicals found in the tissues of pandas are diet and inhalation of polluted air.

 p At the  a href=" wiki Smithsonian_National_Zoological_Park" class="mw-redirect" title="Smithsonian National Zoological Park" Smithsonian National Zoological Park  a , zoo keepers play with giant pandas and switch up their routine. They provide honey, apples, and leaf-eater biscuits inside of the panda toys. The toys are usually made of plastic, rubber, and bamboo to ensure that the pandas don’t break the toys too easily. They let the giant pandas play with water bottles, burlap bags, blankets, boxes, and  a href=" w index.php?title=Fruitsicles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Fruitsicles (page does not exist)" fruitsicles  a - frozen fruit juice and water with cut up fruit inside. The exhibit itself includes a room with a waterfall and rocky outcrop, a den, and several sustainable design features. There are green roofs, a solar hot water system, and natural material for the visitor paths. Not only is the exhibit sustainable, but it also creates an environment that allows for the pandas to stay at a cool temperature when it is hot outside while providing areas for privacy. Short trees, shrubs, pools, and streams, allow them to stay comfortable at all times. sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-15" [15]  a   sup

 p The  a href=" wiki Chapultepec_Zoo" title="Chapultepec Zoo" Chapultepec Zoo  a  (Zoológico de Chapultepec) is one of the four zoos of Mexico city, and it is especially famous for its success in giant panda breeding; in 1980 Chapultepec Zoo became the first institution outside of China to successfully breed the previously endangered species in captivity. In total there have been eight live births at the zoo. The most famous panda to have lived at the zoo is Tohui. Currently two female giant pandas live at the zoo: Shuan Shuan and Xin Xin.
  p 
 p The pandas at Chapultepec are special in that China does not have ownership.The original pair were given to Mexico and subsequent pandas have all been born prior to the change in policy from gifting to loaning. Zoo officials have also come to an agreement with China that any new offspring born at Chapultepec will belong to China, however these pandas will be allowed to stay at the zoo (in contrast to other institutions, where offspring have to be returned to China after reaching five years of age).
