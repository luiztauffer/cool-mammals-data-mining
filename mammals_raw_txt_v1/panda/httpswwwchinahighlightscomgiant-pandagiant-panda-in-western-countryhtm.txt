	Jean Pierre
Armand David was a French priest. When he was 36 years old, he came to China.

	One day in
1869, on his way back to his church, he was invited to have a rest in a farmer's
house. He saw a black-and-white animal skin, which looked like a bear's. He
recognized it as a new species that he had never seen. Nor had anyone else in
the West.

	Father David
hired a hunter to get another giant panda's skin. The hunter brought back two
panda bodies, one young and the other an adult giant panda. He delivered the
giant pandas' skins to Paris, and made quite a stir.

	After their
first appearance in Paris, adventurers and businessmen came from the West to
western China to hunt giant pandas.

	In 1929, Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt Jr.
came to China and became the first Westerners to shoot a giant panda. Later
this giant panda was made into an exhibit and displayed in the Field Museum of
Natural History, Chicago.

	In 1934, Ruth Harkness's husband came to
China to search for giant pandas. But he became seriously ill and died in China
in 1936. Ruth then made it her mission to fulfill his dream to get a live giant
panda to the US. She finally got one and named him Su Lin. She brought Su Lin
to the USA in 1936.

	The first giant pandas in the UK arrived in
London Zoo in 1938.  After this, war and regime change meant there
were no more pandas taken to the West for two decades. Chi Chi, famous as the
logo image of the WWF, was purchased by London Zoo in 1958, and became a star
attraction.

	As giant pandas
mainly live in sub-Tibetan mountainous areas, their English name took a long while
in coming.

	 strong In Chinese  strong , giant pandas
are called  i dàxióngmāo  i  (大熊猫  daa-sshyong-maoww 
' strong big bear cat(s)'  strong ). In ancient
Chinese, they had different names  i pi  i  (貔, a mythical beast),  i he  i  (貉 'raccoon
dog'),  i mo  i  (貘 'tapir'),
etc. But no one gave it a scientific name.
  p 
 p 
	 strong Father David  strong  found that
giant pandas looked like bears, so he classified them (correctly) as bears (Ursidae).
With a different appearance and diet from the black bear, Father David named it  i Ursus melanoleucus  i  (' strong black-and-white bear'  strong )

 p 
	It's probable
that the word "panda" is from  strong the
Nepalese word for red panda  strong :  i nigalya
ponya   i ('bamboo eater',  i ponya  i  means 'bamboo'). Actually,  a href=" giant-panda red-pandas.htm" rel="nofollow" the red panda  a  (or little panda, lesser panda) was named before the giant panda.
  p 
 p 
	Although giant
pandas share habitat preference and diet  span with the red panda  span , as well as an enlarged bone called
a "sixth finger" to help grip bamboo shoots, they actually
belong to different animal families. But that is how the giant panda got its name: because  strong they act and look (somewhat) like red pandas, but are much bigger  strong .
