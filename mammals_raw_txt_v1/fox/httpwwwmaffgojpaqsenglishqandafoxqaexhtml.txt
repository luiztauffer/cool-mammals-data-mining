 p  strong  span class="txt_underline" A:  span   strong When taking a raccoon (fox, skunk) abroad from Japan, it is necessary for the animal to undergo export quarantine. The quarantine is basically a clinical check so no special documentation is required. br  However, some countries require immunization and or medication etc. as part of the conditions of entry into that country, so please check in advance and prepare the necessary documents according to those conditions of entry. Please note that depending on the conditions, special arrangements may be required, or an extended period of time (several days) may be required for the quarantine etc. For this reason, please contact the  a href="http:  www.maff.go.jp aqs english contactus.html" Animal Quarantine Service  a  where your animal will undergo export quarantine as soon as your export plans have been finalised, and submit an  a href="http:  www.maff.go.jp aqs english animal dog import-free.html#export" Export Quarantine Application Form  a  at least seven days in advance of the intended export date. br  When returning to Japan with a raccoon (fox, skunk) that you have taken out of the country, import quarantine is necessary. When bringing the animal back from a country other than an designated region (rabies-free country or region), the quarantine period is 180 days. br  However, if the animal has been brought back from a designated region, the quarantine period may be completed within12 hours, although certain preparations are required to ensure this. It is recommended that you undertake this preparation before leaving Japan, especially in cases when you will be out of Japan for just a short period (two years or less). For further details please refer to section 2 ‘Short trips abroad'.  p

 p  span class="txt_red"  span class="txt_underline" Q:  span Are quarantine procedures affected by the mode of transport used to take animals out?  span   p 
 p  strong  span class="txt_underline" A:  span   strong Raccoons (foxes, skunks) are subject to export quarantine when being taken abroad, regardless of the mode of transport (airplane, ship etc.) or the method of transport (cargo, hand luggage etc.) used. Quarantine procedures are not affected in any way by the shipping method. br  However, certain countries have restrictions on transportation modes and methods, so please check in advance with the foreign embassy in Japan or with the animal quarantine authority. br  br  span class="txt_red"  span class="txt_underline" Q:  span What do I need to be aware of when taking a raccoon (fox, skunk) on an airplane?  span   p 
 p  strong  span class="txt_underline" A:  span   strong Animals can become subject to considerable stress when kept in an unfamiliar place for long period of time, so please pay careful attention to animal health prior to departure. Raccoons (foxes, skunks) that are old, in poor health, pregnant, lactating, have a history of illnesses, on medication or injured are not suited to transportation or the import quarantine at the destination. If it is unavoidable to take such an animal abroad, please consult your vet and airline well in advance, to determine whether or not the animal will be able to cope with the transportation and import quarantine. br  Please make sure that the cages used for transporting the raccoons (foxes, skunks), are large enough for them to stand, sit, sleep, and turn, freely, and have a vent which allows sufficient ventilation in order to transport them safely and avoid injury. Cages should be constructed in such a way that animals cannot poke their snouts or limbs out of the vent or mesh, and should have anti-escape features. br  br  span class="txt_red"  span class="txt_underline" Q:  span How do I go about arranging air transportation for animals?

 p  strong  span class="txt_underline" A:  span   strong Please contact the airline for information.  p
