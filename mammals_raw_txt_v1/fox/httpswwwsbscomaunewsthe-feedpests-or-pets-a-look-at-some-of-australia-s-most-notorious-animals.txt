 p class="text-abstract__content" Among our iconic Skippy kangaroos and cute koalas, Aussie land is actually pest-infested  p 
 p From illegally smuggling pet turtles into the country to purchasing snakes from the black market, there are some Aussies out there who aren’t bothered by what were once traditionally considered pests. Instead, they're choosing to have them as pets.  p 
 p  strong Rabbits  strong  br Rabbits began to hop across Aussie land when the First Fleet docked on our shores in 1788. Known as Australia’s most widespread and harmful environmental and agricultural pest, they damage native plants and prevent seedling regeneration. Deliberately released for hunting, they multiplied in population at the fastest rate of any colonising mammal any where in the world. However, the good news is they still make popular household pets under strict regulation.  p 
 p  strong Cane toad  strong   br Don’t be fooled, these yellow-brown creatures aren’t just any amphibian. They generate potent toxins throughout their bodies, a poison which threatens native species and has seen them categorised as feral animals. Cane toads were deliberately introduced to Australia in 1935 to control another pest at the time, but now have become a pest themselves especially in Queensland where their population is staggering.  p 
 p  strong Red fox br   strong Before being declared a pest in 2014, there were many people who had pet foxes. Introduced to the Australian mainland in the mid-to-late 1800s, red foxes in the wild contributed to the decline of Australian wildlife, including rock-wallabies, eastern grey kangaroos and common brush tail and ring tail possums.  p 
 p  strong American corn snake  strong   br The American corn snake has slithered its way through Australian habitats due to being deliberately released through the illegal pet trade. The snake is a popular pet in countries worldwide, but not in Australia as they hunt our own native species.  p 
 p  strong Red-eared slider turtle  strong   br Known as ‘REST’ and the most widely kept pet animal in the world, these turtles are a serious threat to aquatic biodiversity. Despite their popularity, keeping them as pets in Australia is illegal. According to The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and Australian Customs Service, travellers are commonly caught smuggling them into the country.  p 
 p  strong Feral cats br   strong Despite being one of the nation’s most popular household pets, cats are also one of the leading causes of the decline and extinction of Australian native mammals and birds. Approximately 80 species are at risk from cat predation in Australia.  p
