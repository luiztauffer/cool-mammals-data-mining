 p From the top of mountains to the depths of the sea, the UAE is home to hundreds of animals.  p 
 p Many of these animals are at risk of extinction but recently a rodent, thought to be extinct, and a fox, last sighted in Abu Dhabi 13 years ago, were snapped in the capital's deserts.  p 
 p The photos, taken by camera traps deployed by the Environment Agency — Abu Dhabi, have brought hope that other endangered or elusive animals could also be living across the country.  p 
 p Here are some of the most endangered or vulnerable animals living in the UAE.  p
