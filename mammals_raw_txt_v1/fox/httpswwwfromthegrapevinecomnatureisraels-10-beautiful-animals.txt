 p Israel has so many great things to offer, but one of the absolute must-see things in the country is the amazing flora and fauna. Not only is the plant life beautiful, but Israel is also home to some of the world's most beautiful animals. Here are 10 of the best for you to check out and adore.  p 
 p style="text-align: right;"  a href="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 arabianoryx_marthaenpiet_flickr.jpg"  img alt="Arabian Oryx -with elegant, long horns and white hue make it one of Israel's most beautiful creatures." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3301" height="683" src="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 arabianoryx_marthaenpiet_flickr.jpg" width="1024"   a  small An oryx named "Orry" was picked as the official mascot for the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar.(Photo:  a href="https:  flic.kr p eYcw1T" Martha de Jong-Lantink  a    Flickr)  small 
  p 
 p The Arabian Oryx (or White Oryx) actually went extinct out in the wild during the 1970s, but zoos and wildlife conservationists came to the rescue and were able to reintroduce the antelope back into the wild during the 1980s. While it's no longer considered endangered, the Arabian Oryx's conservation status is still listed as vulnerable. Its elegant, long horns and white hue make it one of Israel's most beautiful creatures.

  p 
 p Just look at those markings! The Fire Salamander is one of the most well-known amphibians in Europe, but it's one of only  em two  em  salamanders (from the order Urodela) left in Israel. The other is the Banded Newt and it's critically endangered. What makes the Fire Salamander so beautiful are its distinct, bold markings with yellow, red, orange (or a mixture of the three) on a stark black background. It's a stunning animal.

  p 
 p Who doesn't love an absolutely adorable cat, right? This is the Internet, after all, so I would be crazy not to include Israel's precious  a href="http:  www.fromthegrapevine.com nature Three-newborn-sand-kittens-melt-our-hearts" Sand Cat  a  in this list. Also known as the Sand Dune Cat, it's the only member of the family of cats that actually lives in the desert, but it doesn't look all that different from most domesticated cats. Its fur is a sandy brownish and it sometimes features darker stripes or spots. Just look at that face!

 p style="text-align: right;"  a href="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 arabianleopard_shankaronline_flickr.jpg"  img alt="Arabian Leopard is the smallest but perhaps the most beautiful leopard subspecies" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3306" height="680" src="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 arabianleopard_shankaronline_flickr.jpg" width="1024"   a  small The Arabian leopard is the largest of all Arabian cats, but is thought to be the smallest of the 15 leopard subspecies. (Photo:  a href="https:  flic.kr p dT5eaT" shankar s.  a    Flickr)  small 
  p 
 p The smallest of all leopards, the Arabian Leopard has been critically endangered since 2006 when it was confirmed that fewer than 200 of the animals were in existence. While it closely resembles the African Leopard, scientists used DNA from a captive leopard found in Israel to determine that the Arabian Leopard is, indeed, its own distinct subspecies. What a beautiful, majestic creature that, hopefully, can bounce back from the brink of extinction.

  p 
 p The Middle East Tree Frog is abundant throughout many regions of the Mediterranean including Israel, Jordan, Cyprus, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Its bright green coloring and distinct brown eyes make it one of the most striking frogs in the area.

 p style="text-align: right;"  a href="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 caracal_andrewhalliday_flickr.jpg"  img alt="The beautiful Caracal is also known as the desert lynx" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3309" height="679" src="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 caracal_andrewhalliday_flickr.jpg" width="1024"   a  small Relatively small creatures, Caracals will not hesitate to kill prey larger then themselves. (Photo:  a href="https:  flic.kr p 6kaFuN" Andrew Halliday  a    Flickr)  small 
  p 
 p Yes, it's technically another cat, but I couldn't resist including the beautiful Caracal in this list of Israel's most beautiful animals. Look at those amazing ears! Also known as the Desert Lynx, the Caracal can be found all over parts of Africa and Asia, but is considered threatened in North Africa. Hunting of the animal is outlawed in many countries, including Israel.

 p style="text-align: right;"  a href="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 marbledpolecat_joachim_s_mueller_flickr.jpg"  img alt="Marbled polecat easily make the list of beautiful animals because of its colorful patterns" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3311" height="768" src="https:  media.fromthegrapevine.com wp-content uploads 2014 04 marbledpolecat_joachim_s_mueller_flickr.jpg" width="1024"   a  small The fur of male marbled polecats changes color during breeding season. (Photo:  a href="https:  flic.kr p 6pX5fk" Joachim S. Müller  a    Flickr)  small 
  p 
 p The Marbled Polecat easily makes this list because of its colorful patterns. The strong white and black neck and head juxtaposed with the marbled brownish, yellow rear end makes it completely adorable. Don't get too close though: Marbled Polecats can emit a strong-smelling secretion (similar to skunks) when they feel threatened.

(Photo:  a href="https:  flic.kr p 6S2KWK" Lilach Daniel  a    Flickr)  small 
  p 
 p The Mountain Gazelle's ornate horns put it in the same category of beautiful animals as the previously mentioned Arabian Oryx. It's brown, black, and white body is quite pleasing to the eye as well, but those horns are something so unique and special that they just set apart the animal from its relatives.

  p 
 p The Syrian Spadefoot (or Eastern Spadefoot) is a toad that's quite abundant from Eastern Europe to Western Asia. It's unique green markings and bulging eyes (with vertical pupils) makes it a really neat-looking creature. Along with the Middle East Tree Frog, it's one of only five animals in Israel from the order Anura.

It actually helps with the Red Fox's balance. (Photo:  a href="https:  flic.kr p ceWFr7" Harley Kingston  a  Flickr)  small 
  p 
 p No, no. Not  a href="http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Redd_Foxx"  em that  em   a  Redd Foxx. This Red Fox is no comedian, but it is one of the most abundant carnivores in the entire Northern Hemisphere. Being so common, however, doesn't detract from the animal's sheer beauty. That golden fur and the sharp angles of its face all make the Red Fox quite the looker.
