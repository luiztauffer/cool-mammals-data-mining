 p class="Body"  span class="C-5" The story of Phil the fox from South London and how one man called Peter saved his life. Phil was suffering very badly with Sarcoptic Mange and was very emaciated. This little fox needed help. The video above explains how Peter managed to catch little Phil so we could take him on for the aftercare and treatment for his mange. To see all the photos of Phil and his full story please visit our Facebook Page here:   span   p

 p class="Normal3 P-6"  span class="C-7"  img alt="" src="AnD.jpg" id="pic_2307" style="float:left;margin:6px;width:427px;height:297px;" Toxoplasmosis: Is a Parasitic Disease caused by the Protozoan Toxoplasmosis gondi. Protozoan being a single- wbr celled microscopic animal. The disease can be found in almost all warm blooded birds and animals, but the only animal that Toxoplasmosis oocysts (A cyst containing a cell) can reproduce is the domestic cat. The oocysts are released in the cat's faeces.   wbr   span   p 
 p class="Normal3 P-6"  span class="C-7" Studies in rats have shown that rats infected with Toxoplasmosis do not fear cat pheromones even though Rodents instinctively shy away from the smells of a cat. So it would seem that for the parasite to complete its life cycle the infected rat would have to be caught by a cat. What better way than to infect the part of the brain that would normally shy away from this and make life harder for the cat to catch the rat! So the cat catches and kills the rat and eats it and the life cycle is complete and ready to start again when the cat goes toilet.   span   p

 p class="Body P-9"  span class="C-11" Martin Hemmington has been studying foxes for over 10 years when he wrote this book, during this which time his admiration for the fox grew so much that he formed the National Fox Welfare Society to which he has devoted himself full time for over 20 years.

 p class="Body P-7"  span class="C-9" Problems with Foxes?  span   p 
 p class="Body P-13"  span class="C-10" Thinking of calling Pest Control? Thinking of spending vast amounts of money on Fox Consultation companies? Think again. Most fox  problems are seasonal and are usually related to fox cubs or juvenile foxes. Fox cubs born in your garden, will leave of their own accord usually in June to early July where they will start travelling further afield with the adult parents. Calling on Pest Control companies to kill the fox is not only cruel but a complete waste of your money. And only lines the pockets of the Company involved. What they do not tell you is usually in August these fox cubs will start to leave the area in search of a territory and mate of their own..  span   p 
 p class="Body P-13"  span class="C-10" Just having an insight into what happens and when can save you hundreds of pounds and importantly without the cruelty that is involved.

If your visiting fox  s are in the early stages, or anything up to 50% hair loss we can send you free mange treatment that can be added to food each night. So if you are looking for mange treatment or mange treatment advice, information, or to just see where Sarcoptic Mange in foxes is occurring around the UK please click on the arrow. In an average month we can send out a staggering 500 - wbr  800 bottles free of charge.   wbr   span   p

 p class="Body P-13"  span class="C-10" The more Equipped Fox Rescuers we have across the country, the more foxes we can rescue. Often we have people volunteer their services free of charge to us in areas where we are desperate for volunteers. Unfortunately we can’t equip everyone with all the equipment that is needed ie Cage Trap, Graspers, Gloves, Carrier and Stretcher. In addition when foxes suffering from life threatening injuries or conditions are reported to us, often we have to put these cases onto a waiting list because we simply do not have enough cage traps to cover all calls. In one area sometimes we can have three people waiting for a trap, as each trap needs to be set for at least a week in our attempts to cage trap the sick foxes, you can see how sometimes, some foxes don’t get the help in time.   span   p
