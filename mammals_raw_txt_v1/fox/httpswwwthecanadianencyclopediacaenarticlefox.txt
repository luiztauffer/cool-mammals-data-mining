Feet and ear tips are black; tail tip, white. Common in farming and wooded areas, they extend from the US border to the  a href=" article tundra " TUNDRA  a  in all provinces, but are absent from coastal British Columbia.

	    They eat rodents,  a href=" article insect " INSECTS  a ,  a href=" article frog " FROGS  a , seeds, fruit, eggs and some poultry. They breed in January and February; usually 4-5 cubs (range 1-10) are born 52-54 days later in a den of earth. Both parents feed them. Cubs become independent at about 6 months and breed in their second year.

They are normally restricted to the tundra and northern coasts. Diet is similar to that of red foxes, and they scavenge other carnivore kills. Mating is in February, with 5-6 (maximum 14) cubs born 50-57 days later. Red and Arctic foxes were farmed for their pelts, but artificial furs have reduced the market.

Undersides are off-white; neck, back of ears and legs are yellowish buff. They are found in southernmost Manitoba, Ontario and Québec.

	    They prefer wooded or broken country and live in hollow logs or overhangs. Grey foxes often climb trees, enjoy sunning themselves and are not strictly nocturnal. Mating is in February to March with litters averaging 4 cubs (range 1-7), born about 63 days later. Young become independent in autumn and breed the following season.

It occurred from southern Alberta to southwestern Manitoba but was considered extirpated from Canada by 1970. Individuals selected from a captive population, bred from animals obtained from Colorado in 1972, have been released since 1983 in the short-grass prairie of southeastern Alberta, near Manyberries and Medicine Hat, and in southwestern Saskatchewan. Some successful breeding in the wild is recorded. Its habits are essentially the same as those of red foxes.
