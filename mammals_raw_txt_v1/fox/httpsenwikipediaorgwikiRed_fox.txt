Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40–45°) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from 0.5–2.5 metres (1 ft 8 in–8 ft 2 in), rarely extending to  a href=" wiki Ground_water" class="mw-redirect" title="Ground water" ground water  a . The main passage can reach 17 m (56 ft) in length, standing an average of 5–7 m (16–23 ft). In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food. sup id="cite_ref-mammals-of-ussr_6-49" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-mammals-of-ussr-6" [6]  a   sup  They may share their dens with woodchucks sup id="cite_ref-mammals-of-na_9-3" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-mammals-of-na-9" [9]  a   sup  or badgers. sup id="cite_ref-mammals-of-ussr_6-50" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-mammals-of-ussr-6" [6]  a   sup  Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in  a href=" wiki Latrine_(animal)" class="mw-redirect" title="Latrine (animal)" latrines  a , red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens. sup id="cite_ref-dale_24-4" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-dale-24" [24]  a   sup  sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;" : span 15–17  span   sup &gt; The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day. sup id="cite_ref-Holland_2011_52-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Holland_2011-52" [52]  a   sup

 p Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. sup id="cite_ref-rwf1987_39-7" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-rwf1987-39" [39]  a   sup  During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats.

 p North American red foxes, particularly those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility.

 p Red foxes may on occasion prey on lambs. Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as  a href=" wiki Scottish_Blackface" title="Scottish Blackface" Blackface  a , are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as  a href=" wiki Merino" title="Merino" Merino  a . Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young. sup id="cite_ref-rwf1987_39-22" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-rwf1987-39" [39]  a   sup  sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;" : span 166–167  span   sup

This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food. sup id="cite_ref-rwf1987_39-23" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-rwf1987-39" [39]  a   sup  sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;" : span 180–181  span   sup

Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a  a href=" wiki Domesticated_silver_fox" class="mw-redirect" title="Domesticated silver fox" population of foxes  a  whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included  a href=" wiki Piebald" title="Piebald" piebald  a  coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves. sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-87" [87]  a   sup

 p Red foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs, sup id="cite_ref-z132_37-3" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-z132-37" [37]  a   sup  although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside. Throughout the twentieth century, they established themselves in many Australian, European, Japanese, and North American cities.

In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.
  p 
 p Urban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-91" [91]  a   sup  Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs. sup id="cite_ref-Urban_Foxes_89-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Urban_Foxes-89" [89]  a   sup

 p Urban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing. sup id="cite_ref-Urban_Foxes_89-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Urban_Foxes-89" [89]  a   sup  In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method. sup id="cite_ref-Fieldsportschannel_92-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Fieldsportschannel-92" [92]  a   sup  However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return. sup id="cite_ref-Urban_Foxes_89-3" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Urban_Foxes-89" [89]  a   sup
