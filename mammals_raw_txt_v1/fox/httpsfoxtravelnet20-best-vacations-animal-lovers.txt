 p Do you love animals? If you’re anything like me, you’ll have at least one (or more) bucket list vacation that involves seeing animals in their natural habitat. Well, you’re about to get a few more! Below, I will tell you about the 20 Best Vacations for Animal Lovers, in no particular order!  p 
 p We at  a href="https:  foxtravel.net " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Fox Travel  a  love animals. Hello! We are called  strong Fox   strong Travel! We also know that sometimes animal encounters are found to be less than ethical. All options below are an ethical, educational, or a conservatory way to see these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.  p 
 p  em  strong For many of these adventures, some tour offers include:     strong    em   p 
 p  em Either free round-trip air, free one-way air, or an air credit of $500 on certain trips and only from certain gateways. They are also offering free bar tabs and tips on select sailings as well.  Offers subject to change without notice and vary by supplier or cruise line.  em   p 
 p Sloths are kind of my spirit animal. They’re cute, cuddly, love to sleep a lot, and just hang out. Just one look at a sloth’s adorable face and many people fall in love. Costa Rica is the best place in the world to see a sloth in their natural habitat. But because they are so adept at camouflaging themselves high up in the trees, it might be easier to visit a sloth sanctuary which is on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica. Down the road is also a Jaguar sanctuary as well! If you are staying on the Pacific side, don’t worry, you can visit the  a href="http:  www.diamanteecoadventurepark.com en" Diamante Eco Adventure Park  a  where you’ll be able to see sloths, and many other animals native to Costa Rica, like monkeys, birds, and more close up, or you can even horseback ride through the jungle! So many great animal adventures to have in Costa Rica!  p 
 p    p 
 p You better “Belize” that you’ll find some great options to see animals in this wonderful country! Whether you’re stopping off for the day on your Caribbean cruise from Galveston or staying for a while, there are plenty of options to see animals in their natural habitat. One of the top attractions is to visit the Community Baboon Sanctuary to see Howler Monkeys swinging from tree to tree. You can also see manatees, crocodiles, parrots and other birds, jaguars and more in Belize.  p 
 p    p 
 p You don’t need to leave the country to see Manatees in their natural habitat. Florida is a great location to see them bobbing in the warm water. Also known as the “Cow of the Sea”, manatees are a sweet and sensitive animal. There are many eco-friendly tour options in Florida to see these magnificent animals in their natural habitat.  p 
 p    p 
 p Take a cruise down to Antarctica and walk among thousand of Gentoo, Chin Strap, and Adelie penguins. Many cruise lines are now making this popular trek down to Antarctica but for a more “natural” experience, I would choose a cruise with Lindblad and  a href="https:  foxtravel.net adventure-travel " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Natural Geographic Expeditions  a . This will give you a truly unique perspective on the life of an Antarctic penguin.  p 
 p    p 
 p For many people riding on elephants on the beach in Thailand is a dream vacation. However, many animal lovers are finding out that the conditions for these wonderful creatures are less than ideal. Don’t worry though, there are still plenty of ethical options to interact with elephants in Thailand! Many of these tour options are elephant sanctuaries, and while they don’t let you ride on them, you can help hand feed them, and even take them down to the river and give them a bath. How cool is that?  p 
 p    p 
 p Our own backyard holds many amazing opportunities to see animals in their natural habitat. One of the best places to see a wide variety of animals is  a href="https:  foxtravel.net weve-been-there-alaska-vacation " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Alaska  a . Interact with Sled Dogs, watch many different species of bears graze in the forest, see bald eagles soar over the Alaskan wilderness, moose, caribou, and bison on land. Alaska is also a great place to go whale watching during the summer. On a  a href="https:  foxtravel.net cruises " target="_blank" rel="noopener" cruise  a  or a whale watching expedition, you can see humpback whales, blue whales, orcas, sea lions, seals, and more. Not only do you get to see all these amazing animals up close, you also get to be in one of the most beautiful untouched wilderness in America. It’s a win win.  p 
 p    p 
 p Made famous by Charles Darwin’s study of plants and animals and his theory of natural selection, the  a href="https:  foxtravel.net galapagos-islands " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Galapagos Islands  a  are teeming with species found only on these tiny islands. Because of this, it is considered one of the world’s foremost destinations for animal viewing. Some of the more famous residents unique to these islands are the Galapagos tortoise with a lifespan of 170 years, the only living Marine Iguana left on earth, Galapagos finches which played a huge role in Darwin’s theory, Galapagos penguin the smallest and only penguin north of the equator, and much more.  p 
 p    p 
 p Animal lovers will love this trip. Indonesia is a group of islands the make up an area south of Philippians and north of Australia. Some of the more well-known islands are Sumatra, Java, and New Guinea. These islands hold some of the rarest and endangered species in the world. Animals like the Sumatran Tiger, Orangutan, Javan Rhino, and the Komodo Dragon to name a few, are extremely endangered and very rare. There are many tour companies, like  a href="https:  foxtravel.net adventure-travel " target="_blank" rel="noopener" National Geographic  a , that will take you to Indonesia and try to get you the opportunity to see these beautiful animals up close.  p 
 p    p 
 p While Polar Bears live in many northern polar countries like Norway and Russia, one of the easiest locations to see them, for Americans, is Churchill, Canada. Up here you will be able to see the largest bear and the largest land carnivore in the world. While visiting this snowy Tundra, you will also have a chance to do a dog sledding excursion, see the arctic fox, arctic wolves, reindeer and more.  p 
 p Probably one of the most popular and well-known vacation to see animals is doing an African Safari. Here you will be able to see many different species of animals all in the same day. You can even camp out in the wilderness with the animals all around you! Not a fan of camping? There are many luxury hotels that will still allow you to get in on the animal action. Here you can see African elephants, giraffes, rhinos, lions, cheetah, and more. Some of our favorite vendors for an African Safari are  a href="https:  foxtravel.net adventure-travel " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Abercrombie &amp; Kent, and Micato Safaris  a   p 
 p When on vacation do you miss your furry friend? Don’t worry, on Kauai you can “rent a dog” from the local shelter for the time of your stay. What happens if you fall in love? They will help you bring your new puppy pal back to the states with you! Other animals to see in Hawaii are dolphins, sea turtles, whales, sharks, and more! Hawaii is a beautiful tropical destination with much more to offer than just lounging on the beach.  a href="https:  foxtravel.net best-hawaiian-island-visit " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Can’t decide which Hawaiian island to visit? We’ve got your back!   a   p 
 p One of the most popular excursions for animal lovers to do here is swim with the sharks! Many people flock to this area for the chance to swim and even feed sharks while scuba diving. The Bahamas has the largest population of sharks anywhere in the Caribbean. From the Caribbean and blacktip reef sharks to tiger and nurse sharks, there are sharks here for everyone. For the more timid try nurse sharks (I mean, you are still pretty brave for swimming with sharks) to the adventurous, swim with those large tiger sharks! If swimming with sharks is not your thing, you can also swim with… Pigs? Yup! I said pigs! There is a small island that is inhabited with little piggy’s that just love to swim with tourists.  p 
 p One of the cutest, most lovable creatures in the world has to be a Panda Bear. Just watch a video of a panda and you will see this silly personality shine through. Although you can see pandas in Zoos around the world, China is the only place to see these animals in the wild. You will be trekking through a huge jungle to try to find them, so it is probably better if you visit them at a breeding center instead where they work around the clock to help bring these wonderful creatures back from the brink of extinction.  p 
 p Many people know the 2 most popular animals in Australia, the kangaroo and koala. Australia is a great place to visit if you have people in your group that aren’t super interested in spending your entire vacation looking at animals (who are these people anyways?). There is a ton of super fun activities to do in many of the great cities, but this blog is about animals. Take a hike in the bush to see many of Australia’s unique animals, many found only there, in their natural habitat.  p 
 p    p 
 p Yellowstone is known for its natural beauty, but there are a ton of animals to see here like bison, moose, wolves, bighorn sheep, bears, mountain lions and more. This is another animal gem right in our backyard. Yellowstone is a must-see for any nature and animal lover. Another location where you can either camp or stay in a hotel, Yellowstone makes for a great vacation for all. But what am I saying, check out any of our amazing national parks to see unique wildlife all over the USA.  p 
 p    p 
 p Did you know there is a beach in Maryland and Virginia that are teaming with wild horses? These wild horses are now used to people since the beach makes for a popular hangout for both people and horses, but never-the-less, they are still wild. Some though may even let you pet them. Horse lovers are animal lovers too!  p 
 p    p 
 p Take it from a person that has grown up riding. Riding a horse through the Irish countryside is probably one of the best animal experiences I have had. There is something pretty magical about Ireland, but seeing the country on horseback is pretty spectacular. This is another great location to visit for a unique animal experience, but still, have plenty to do for those that don’t want to spend their entire vacation with animals.  p 
 p    p 
 p While you are on your African safari, take a side trip to Rwanda, Uganda or Kenya to see Mountain Gorillas in their natural habitat. This is a must do for all animal lovers while in Africa. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to see a gorilla in these mountains, mainly because their territory is so large, and you have to go on foot. These beautiful and intelligent creatures are endangered, so if these guys are on your bucket list, I would plan your trip soon!  p 
 p You’ve seen these guys hanging out in the hot springs in snowy Kyoto, Japan, which is about a five-hour drive from Tokyo. These characters love to bathe and swim in these pools, and they are so much fun to watch. Again, Japan makes for a great destination for those that want to do other activities as well.  p 
 p    p 
 p If you have never been scuba diving or even snorkeling, then you won’t understand when someone says that being 50 feet underwater is as close to being in a different world as possible. Some of my most memorable animal lovers encounters happened while scuba diving. The best part about scuba diving is you can pretty much dive anywhere with water, even lakes! There is so much life teeming underneath the waves that will blow you away. From the very small fish, shrimp, and crabs, to the largest turtles, whales, whale sharks, dolphins, and sharks, you will see something new every time you dive. If you happened to go diving during whale watching season, you can hear the whales calling from miles away, it’s a pretty incredible adventure for animal lovers.  p 
 p    p 
 p  em Remember animal lovers, no matter where you go, or whatever animals you see, please remember that these are wild animals. They are adapted to life in their area, please don’t handle, feed, or interfere with any animal in the wild. While your intentions may be good, it could impact them in a negative way. And please, if you want to take a picture with or of an animal, please make sure you are at a safe distance.  em   p
