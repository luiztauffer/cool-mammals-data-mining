Elephants are found all over Thailand, and whilst their numbers are falling, there are still wild elephants to be found in the forests. Smaller than their African counterparts, Thailand’s elephants are majestic and playful, with elephant sanctuaries throughout the country offering unforgettable, intimate and ethical encounters with them – just  a href="https:  theculturetrip.com asia thailand articles why-you-should-think-twice-before-riding-an-elephant " make sure not to ride them  a .  p

Though there are less than 300 to be found in the wild, hopes of an increase of their numbers have been buoyed recently by the news that they have found to be breeding. Captive tigers are subject to cruelty and poor treatment, so think twice before supporting places that offer tiger interactions.  p

Whilst not critically endangered, their status is vulnerable, but there are foundations working to ensure bear populations increase and helping to educate others about them. Bear populations are found throughout Thailand, including tourist hotspots Khao Sok national park in Surat Thani and Khao Yai national park.  p

Whilst not uncommon, their shy nature and proficiency at climbing trees makes them hard to spot, but you might smell them – their musk is said to reminiscent of popcorn!  p

Pangolins have hard scales all over their body, and their defence mechanism is to curl into a ball. However, this makes them easy to catch for traffickers, who smuggle them into China where they’re used for traditional medicine. As a result, their numbers have dramatically fallen, but if you’re lucky you might get to meet one of the strange-looking but cute creatures in the wild.  p

Growing in excess of five meters in length, meeting one is sure to be daunting though they’re unlikely to attack unless threatened. It’s thought that baby king cobras are more dangerous than the adults as they can’t control the venom they use, often packing a very high dose when they bite.  p

Before you see one, you’re more likely to hear it first – it’s call (which sounds like “tokay”) can often be heard through the night in Thailand. Beautifully coloured, they’re a real treat to find, but you shouldn’t try to and handle one – they pack a mean bite and often won’t let go without a fight!  p

Gibbons are incredible tree swingers – they can swing as far as 15m in one swing and at a speed of 55km per hour. Whilst it might be hard to spot them high up in the trees, their call is easily distinguishable and can even be heard up to a kilometer away.  p

Whilst they can be seen on islands, in rainforests and on beaches, they can also be found in urban locations. Bangkok’s Lumphini Park is famous for its water monitor population, with dozens of these giant found creatures living in peace in the lake and they are often spotted going about their business in the park itself.  p
