Along with fluffy kittens and orangutans building their own hammocks, sloths have become a bonafide internet sensation in recent years. With their permanently contented smiles, beady little sleepy eyes and adorably fluffy babies – sloth videos and photos have the ability to make grown men swoon with delight. Really! Did you know, that once upon a time, sloths were the size of elephants and incredibly aggressive?  p 
 p The mind boggles. We know!  p 
 p 1. Next time you catch yourself doing or saying something rather silly, take heart. Some sloths have been known to grab their own arms – mistaking them for tree branches – and end up falling to their death. *Sigh*  p 
 p 2. Sloths only enjoy, on average, one bowel movement a week. When they do finally do a #2, they can expel up to a third of their entire body weight.  p 
 p 3. Sloths are 3 times faster in water than they are on land. Their preferred swimming style is the backstroke.  p 
 p 4. As a means of self-preservation, sloths don’t stink (they don’t sweat at all) thus avoiding being detected by predators. However, just because they don’t smell, it certainly doesn’t mean they aren’t dirty! Sloths’ hairy coats are cosy habitats for innumerable colonies of insects, algae and bugs.  p

 p 5. Ancient giant sloths – known as  a href="https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Megatherium" target="_blank" rel="noopener" Megatherium  a  – were believed to be up to 7 metres tall, weighed about 7 tonnes and had quite the aggressive disposition. Nowadays, you can see a full-scale skeleton of a Megatherium at London’s Natural History Museum.  p 
 p 6. The three-toed sloth can turn his head almost 360 degrees!  p 
 p 7. Sloths give birth whilst hanging upside down.  p 
 p 8. Sloth are actually built upside down! Well, sort of! Sloths spend an inordinate amount of time hanging upside down, something they can only do because their main organs are attached to their rib cage, so they don’t compress their lungs.  p

The sloths’ love of a long siesta is actually a misconception – recent research undertaken in the forests of  a href="http:  www.chimuadventures.com blog 2016 02 panama-canal-10-facts-you-didnt-know " Panama   a has shown that sloths only sleep between 8 and 10 hours a day, much like us.  p
