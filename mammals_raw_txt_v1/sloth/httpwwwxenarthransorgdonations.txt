 p Are you concerned about the future of our planet?   p 
 p Many wild Xenarthra populations are enduring threats to their long-term survival throughout South and Central America. Some of these elusive species are so poorly known that we cannot even assess how many of them are left, evaluate their chances of survival, or initiate conservation plans. Xenarthrans are notoriously understudied, probably because fieldwork with anteaters, sloths or armadillos is such a supremely challenging task.   p 
 p However, there is hope: a growing, enthusiastic community of graduate students, researchers, educators, and captive care specialists are dedicated to the study and conservation of these secretive and increasingly threatened mammals. They need YOUR help.   p 
 p Your contribution can help save anteaters, sloths and armadillos from extinction!   p 
 p If you wish to donate field equipment for conservation research, help develop environmental education programs in habitat countries, or financially support our activities, please  a target="_blank" href=" contact" contact  a  Dr. Mariella Superina, Chair of the IUCN SSC Anteater, Sloth and Armadillo Specialist Group.  p 
 p Your support, no matter how large or small, will make a difference to the conservation of these strange-looking, charismatic animals!  p
