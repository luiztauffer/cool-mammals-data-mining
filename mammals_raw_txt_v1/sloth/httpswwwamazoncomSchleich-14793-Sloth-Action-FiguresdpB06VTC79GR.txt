            The sloth spends almost its entire life in the trees of tropical rainforests. Its curved claws give it a firm grip on the branches of the trees. Since it always hangs from the branches upside down, the slothâ€™s fur grows from its belly towards its back, instead of growing from its back or head. This allows rainwater to drain away better.
