 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong The Project:   strong This one-of-a-kind project is a lifeline for abused and endangered animals in the Southern Peruvian Amazon rainforest. Many of the animals at the centre are rescued from the illegal trafficking and pet trade or abusive homes; the animals often arrive injured or stressed. Animals are also brought in sick or dying by local people because of hunting accidents.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Project Location:  strong  The Peru Wildlife Sanctuary is in the southern Peruvian Amazon near the city of Puerto Maldonado; less than 1 hour by plane or 10 hours by bus from Cusco.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Main Volunteer Activities:  strong  Caring for rescued animals, preparing their food and feeding the animals. Maintaining the upkeep of the sanctuary; including repairing enclosures, cutting leaves &amp; trees and improving enclosure enrichment for the animals.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Hours:  strong  Volunteers work for 6 to 8 hours per day, 6 days per week.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Duration:  strong  Volunteer placements are year-round and for 1 to 12 weeks.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Accommodation:  strong  Shared rooms in simple rustic accommdoation blocks in a clearing in the jungle.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Volunteer Requirements:  strong  The minimum age for this project is 18 unless accompanied by an adult &amp; a passion for animal welfare.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;"  strong Volunteer Placement Fee:  strong  From UK£435   US$565  span   p

 p The sanctuary is on 10 hectares of land, approximately 11 kilometres outside of the city of  strong Puerto Maldonado  strong . The sanctuary is surrounded by nature; but also still close enough to the city where you can find i strong nternet cafes, restaurants  strong  and other  strong stores  strong . If you need to go into town for any reason a taxi ride is roughly 35 Soles (about US$10.50 or £8.25) each way.  p 
 p The Amazon rainforest, which is the biggest and most diverse rainforest in the world, covers more than half of Peru. It is home to thousands of unique and  strong endangered animals  strong , plants and ecosystems; some of which are only found locally.  p 
 p Without a sustainable rescue centre, there would be nowhere in the area for rescued animals to be taken for  strong rehabilitation;  strong  and where feasible,  strong release  strong  back into the wild.  strong Volunteers  strong  play a vital role in helping the day to day running of the sanctuary. As well as supporting the physical and psychological wellbeing of the animals being rehabilitated at the shelter.  p 
 p Volunteers assist  strong local qualified staff  strong  with the care of the animals and maintenance of the wildlife rescue centre. Volunteers contribute to the protection of endangered animals and preserving the unique biodiversity of the Amazon Rainforest.  p

 p  span style="color: #000000;" Whether you plan your entire trip in advance or decide to wait until you get to Peru our well-travelled team can offer advice and help in planning  strong the perfect itinerary;  strong  for your weekends or for travel  strong before or after your placement  strong . Staff at the project can give you lots of tips for where to visit locally. Here are just a few of the rest of Peru’s treasures to whet your appetite.  span   p 
 p Cusco is a beautiful city that has something to offer everyone! Ffrom  strong Inca ruins  strong  and splendid  strong Spanish colonial architecture  strong  to elegant squares and outstanding mountain scenery. The historic city centre is a lively hub of  strong cafes, restaurants  strong  and  strong bars;   strong with dozens of  strong boutiques, markets  strong  and  strong shops  strong  offering an astonishing range of unique locally made goods. There are museums, galleries, churches and monasteries to visit. Every Sunday sees a magnificent civil parade in the City’s stunning main square, the  strong Plaza de Armas  strong .  p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Cusco’s Indian and Catholic traditions are frequently celebrated with  strong street parades, live music  strong  and  strong food stalls;   strong springing up across the city at any excuse. There are also some wonderful walks and hikes in and around the city centre. You can stroll amongst whitewashed houses and along the cobbled lanes in the Bohemian quarter of  strong San Blas.   strong Climb high above the city to the Inca fortress at  strong Sacsayhuaman  strong  and take in the unrivalled views of the city and the surrounding Andes.  span   p 
 p The Sacred Valley of the Incas is a must-see on anyone’s Peru itinerary. Barely half an hour’s drive from Cusco, where you will find a magical, steep-sided valley. Fresh mountain rivers and streams tumble between ancient mountains and majestic glaciers.  p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The Sacred Valley’s centuries-old towns and villages are home to remarkably reserved  strong Inca forts  strong  and citadels;  strong markets  strong  with traditional textiles and souvenirs draw visitors to lovely towns like  strong Pisac, Chinchero  strong  and  strong Ollantaytambo  strong . The amazing salt terraces and pre-Inca agricultural terraces at  strong Maras  strong  are also an easy day trip from Cusco.    span   p 
 p Surely the number one reason that many visitors come to Peru is to visit the wonder of  strong Machu Picchu  strong . Whatever you read and no  matter how many photos you have see; nothing can quite prepare you for the first time you see the Inca citadel rising high above a bend in the river.  p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Machu Picchu is easily accessible from Cusco. You can go there by  strong luxury  strong   strong train  strong , trek the amazing  strong Inca Trail  strong  high in the Andes or other alternative treks; all ending with lost city itself. Built, but never completed by the Incas around 1450 the Inca capital was only re-discovered in 1911. The breath-taking lost city of the Incas is now discovered by hundreds of charmed visitors daily.  span   p 
 p Lake Titicaca, the  strong highest navigable lake in the world,  strong  is around 6-8 hours from Cusco. Perfect for long weekends or those travelling before or after their volunteer placement. Here you can take a cruise on the lake or visit the famous floating  strong Uros Islands.   strong Do a spot of star gazing in one of the least light-polluted skies on the planet.  p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" You are almost certain to travel through Lima on your way to Puerto Maldonado. Peru’s capital is worth a stop before or after your volunteer placement. There is excellent shopping in the ocean-side district of Miraflores. Wonderful galleries and museums in trendy Barranco. Some truly impressive Spanish colonial buildings in the historic centre and amazing restaurants throughout the city.  span   p 
 p The city of Arequipa is  strong Peru’s second largest city  strong . It is known as the white city due to the colour of the historic buildings constructed using local white stone called sillar. Arequipa is located in the Andes mountains bit at a lower altitude so enjoys almost year-round warm, sunny weather. The city is overlooked by the magnificent dormant volcano  strong El Misti  strong .  p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Arequipa is also the staging post for trips to the Famous  strong Colca Canyon  strong .  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" Globalteer has negotiated generous discounts for our volunteers with a well-respected agency in Cusco. They can arrange trips such as Machu Picchu, Amazon tours, Lake Titicaca; as well as many other amazing trips in Peru and South America.  span   p

			I first volunteered at Picaflor House Children's Community Project in Peru in 2014, as a solo traveller, staying in Cusco span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  for two months. I think it speaks volumes for the quality and impact of the experience, that I returned for a second trip at the end of last year - this time for just two weeks, but with my husband, as part of a wider trip through South America. Two very different visits, but both equally rewarding and life-changing. During my first trip, I met with a wide variety of lovely volunteers from all over the world, some of whom I am still in touch with today. In contrast, on our recent trip, we were the only volunteers. However, this allowed us to sample a broad range of experience at the project, and the opportunity to take more responsibility - we got to run two days worth of Art lessons which was great fun, and a real eye-opener, especially for my husband, who had no previous classroom experience. The volunteering at Picaflor is very flexible - our individual skills were used to their best advantage. I focussed on the English classes, using my language and communication training to the full, and my husband worked in the Nursery class, supporting the children to develop their social and practical skills (and honing his fledgling Spanish). In addition, on my first much longer trip, I was able to take the odd day off, enabling me to take in the local art and culture by visiting places of interest further afield. Picaflor House is a really valuable resource for Oropesa. It provides occupation and fun for the children in the afternoon after their school day finishes, allowing parents to work full days, and provides extra academic support, especially with English - particularly important as it enables the children to get better jobs when they leave school. The children at Picaflor are extremely lively (expect more noise, and less formal seated activity than in your average British school), but on both trips we particularly enjoyed the sporting days (as did the children!) on Fridays when everybody came together to play volleyball, football, and to skip, play on the swings and slide, and to dig in the sandpit - Chris enjoyed a particularly muscle-building day breaking up and raking the sand for the children, and I enjoyed a spot of gardening - as I said the experience was very varied!The regular, permanent staff at Picaflor are particularly supportive. We were prepared well in advance - I particularly needed this reassurance on my first trip alone, and even though on my second trip, I knew where everything was, we were confident that we could still access any extra help if needed. As a couple, we received an especially warm welcome on my return, and would definitely consider a third visit in the future. I would highly recommend Picaflor to future volunteers 🙂  span   a class="wprs_rd_less" style="display:none;" read less  a 		  p

Volunteering in local schools allowed me to see parts of the area that I wouldn't have been able to as a tourist, and coaching sports to the school children offered me a chance to interact with locals and engage in their culture. Communication with Globalteer leading up to and during my trip was easy and constant. All the staff and volunteers I worked with were very friendly and supportive, always eager to help me out with any issues or concerns I had. Free time during the evenings and weekends allowed me to explore and enjoy what Siem Reap has to offer.

			Late last year I was able to spend a month in Peru to volunteer at two of the Globalteer programs- span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  The Dog Shelter in Cusco and The Amazon Wildlife Sanctuary in Puerto Maldonado. It was organised so well and I felt so comfortable throughout the whole process. I was picked up from the airport and the staff made me feel so welcome and at home. Being a young girl in a country like Peru, my family and friends were quite worried at first, as was I, however, I felt safe the entire time. I didn't have to worry one bit about the organisation of both volunteer groups, even though they were on the opposite sides of the country, it was an easy process with the staff being so quick and prompt in replies and helpful when I arrived in Cusco. I genuinely had an incredible time with so many life lessons and learning experiences taught throughout the trip. Would definitely recommend even if this is your first time overseas alone - as it was mine.  span   a class="wprs_rd_less" style="display:none;" read less  a 		  p

			I had the amazing opportunity to volunteer with Globalteer at the Northern Thailand Elephant Sanctuary! It was amazing being at span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  this sanctuary and if you love being outdoors with animals then I highly recommend this one. One of the best things about this sanctuary is that you can stay overnight! It is incredible to see the elephants before you turn in for the night and then watch them get bathed in the morning as you eat your breakfast. This trip was very well organized by Globalteer. The sanctuary is small but it gives you the chance to really see the animals in their natural habitat. You can participate in feedings and sit in bungalows out in the jungle and just watch these magnificent creatures. Meals are filling and delicious and I highly recommend staying for a few nights.  span   a class="wprs_rd_less" style="display:none;" read less  a 		  p

			Having chosen to spend three-weeks volunteering on a Cambodia Community Project in Siem Reap, a perfect school placement was found, span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  which allowed me to gain one of my most memorable life experiences to date. The regional Globalteer team in Asia managed to find an excellent placement school, which not only allowed me to gain new skills, but also share my teacher training experiences with others.From the moment I landed in Siem Reap, the local Globalteer helped me to settle in, and remained available as a support network, as well as my fellow volunteers. Regular catch-up nights meant that a shared social life was available. Such events facilitated wide-ranging conversations between volunteers who were working on a range of different projects whilst in town. At the same time, space was afforded for each volunteer to shape their own experiences.Globalteer employ members of staff who themselves have a passion for travelling and volunteering, and it’s this methodology that helps create a great experience for their volunteers. It’s therefore my pleasure to highly recommend Globalteer projects to future volunteers.  span   a class="wprs_rd_less" style="display:none;" read less  a 		  p

			Coming from a country with very few organisations that offer international volunteering jobs (Austria), I had to trust online reviews span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  from other volunteers when I tried to find a suitable project for my sabbatical. And in my research, Globalteer was described as a very reliable organisation which offers an authentic insight into the countries where it operates. As a volunteer of the Cambodia Community Project for 4 weeks where I worked as a teacher in the rural Helping Hands Cambodia School outside of Siem Reap, I can only say that I had made the best choice. Everyting worked out perfectly - all my questions were answered promptly before my stay, I felt very much taken care of during the project and I met amazing people who worked on other Globalteer projects and they have all become an important part of my life. I think my teaching job out there in the country couldn't have given me a better insight into the life of this young country. I feel very much connected with the teachers and especially these fantastic kids that I met and since my return I have been following all their projects very closely.

This experience was one of span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  the most rewarding things I have done - it opened my eyes to how other cultures in different countries cope without luxuries that we take for granted each day. Each week consisted of 3 days of building the water filters and 2 days going to the different villages and giving the water filters to those who needed them. All of the stages were important and I felt like I was really making a real difference. Each morning I woke up excited and full of energy to meet the other amazing volunteers and start our work for the day! I loved going into the villages the most, as you could see how grateful the locals were to receive such an important gift into their lives! After my two weeks of volunteering I managed to get a job with globalteer running the sports project ... yes that is how much I fell in love with Cambodia, the people, the culture and their way of thinking!

			Mid-life crisis?  Mid-life adventure?  It could have been either.....or even a break from the husband! Following retirement from span class="wprs_rd_more_dots" ...  span   a class="wprs_rd_more" read more  a  span class="wprs_rd_more_text" style="display:none;"  a demanding career in 2014 I had the luxury and freedom to enjoy being a lady that could wine and dine to her heart’s content but deep down I still yearned for a challenge. Then I came across the amazing opportunity, along with a friend, to work with underprivileged children in Cusco, Peru. This was for a month under Globalteer. I was able to be part of an inspirational and holistic after-school project for 70 children aged from 3-14 in a mountain village near Cusco. The project gives free classes and help with homework to underprivileged children, plus a safe place to play, to learn traditional music and dance, to enjoy free fruit, clean drinking water and a nutritious lunch.Once our applications had been accepted and the relevant checks completed I embarked on a fundraising campaign. Individual Just Giving pages were set up and I approached various companies to donate much needed items for the children such as educational books, art supplies, toys and clothing. My local M&amp;S were very supportive and donated underwear and socks. Anxiety, apprehension and anticipation were just some of the feelings experienced but the time to embark on the adventure soon came round and we flew from Heathrow to Cusco via Bogota. The accommodation was in a family ‘homestay’ as we wanted to embrace and immerse ourselves in the culture and be part of a Peruvian family and also to practice the little Spanish I had learnt. In fact there were 11 people in the house in Wanchaq on the outskirts of Cusco. The family were very friendly and welcoming but you soon began to appreciate what you had left behind and not to take anything for granted.Altitude sickness was the first issue that had to be dealt with. Cusco is around 3400m above the sea level which can present a problem because the human body starts to react at around 2500m. Thankfully after taking the local remedy of Coca Tea and being given oxygen we were up and about after 36 hours.Meeting the children for the first time at Picaflor House was a very emotional experience and brought on the first of many tears. At the end of the first day with them I felt so privileged and humbled to have met them. They had nothing but were always smiling and wanting to hold your hand. I assisted with English classes, Mathematics and activities such as music, crafts and  games on a Friday. They delighted in playing the simplest of games such as ‘Piggy In The Middle’ which started off with 3 and then everyone wanted to participate! The older girls made makeshift swings one day from cardboard and ropes! We were advised not to have favourites but I have to own up to having a soft spot for the Kindergarten class!The ongoing project focuses on the young and vulnerable to assist them in finding a way out of the trap of poverty and is aimed at keeping the children in a secure environment off the streets, and providing them with a safe place to learn and enjoy being children. I did witness in various parts of the area young children on their own begging in the streets or trying to sell sweets to motorists whilst waiting at the traffic lights. Sadly despite the wealth of tourist money that enters the country, very little of the money filters down to the average Peruvian and millions live in extreme poverty. This means a lack of education, healthcare and nutrition effects the poorest the hardest. Many homes have no running water or proper sanitation and heating is unheard of. With volunteers Globalteer hope to help the least fortunate live healthily, with dignity and with a future.We caught a local bus to and from the project. The journey was just under 1 hour each way and cost 3.50 soles return – approx £1!  On one of our weekends off we visited Machu Picchu – an incomparable wonder and despite having seen so many pictures nothing prepares you for the first time you see the Inca citadel rising high above a bend in the river. It was well worth the 3.45 am alarm call to see the sunrise which was absolutely breath-taking.Another challenge we took on was to eat the local dish ‘Cuy’ – otherwise known as guinea pig!  A Peruvian delicacy it is either fried or roasted and cooked whole. We ate it with our hands and although the meat looked like the dark meat of chicken it tasted more like duck. I also celebrated my birthday whilst out there and I gave the children a small bag of ‘Haribo’ sweets as a treat. They were absolutely delighted and so happy to have in their eyes such a luxury. I didn’t need to translate in to Spanish on this occasion – I think ‘sweets’ is a universal language!The trip was an incredible experience not only because of the gratifying sensation of helping in a foreign and vulnerable country, but also learning more about ourselves and appreciating what we have. The children made a lasting impression and I do have intentions to one day return. Volunteering at Piclafor House has taught me to never take things for granted and to realise how we can manage with far less than we think we need – I have a wardrobe of clothes so why do I think I need more? I left a case of clothes and toiletries for a lady I met and she actually filled with tears when she saw the bottle of shampoo I had donated. The trip has changed my outlook on life and I believe that this is only the start of my volunteering career! I would recommend volunteering with Globalteer to anyone who wants to have a memorable life experience.  span   a class="wprs_rd_less" style="display:none;" read less  a 		  p
