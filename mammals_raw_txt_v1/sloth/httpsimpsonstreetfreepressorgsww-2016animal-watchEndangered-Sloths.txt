 p Human activities have endangered the pygmy three-toed sloth. Pygmy sloths only live in tropical rainforests. Their habitat varies from Central American countries, such as Honduras, to South American countries, such as Brazil. There are many different types of sloths, but their population overall is decreasing.   p 
 p 	The red mangrove forest of Isla Escudo de Veraguas is a remote island off the coast of Panama and home to the pygmy sloth. Pygmy sloths protect themselves by covering their coats with blue-green algae, providing camouflage as they hang on tree foliage. The pygmy sloth is very inactive. However, lack of movement actually protects it from predators.  p 
 p           When sloths are not being inactive, they spend much of their time eating leaves. The only time pygmy sloths move fast is when they are threatened. The pygmy sloth only uses as much energy as needed. The pygmy sloth has two cousins: the Pale throat three-toed sloth and the two-toed sloth, which live in Central and South America.  The two-toed sloth is similar to the pygmy sloth because they are both nocturnal.  p 
 p             The three-toed sloth is different from its two-toed cousin. The two-toed sloth is normally heavier and has a less mobile neck. Another difference is that the two-toed sloth eats small animals as well as leaves but the three-toed sloth has a completely vegetarian diet.  p 
 p 	Deforestation and poaching has made the species of the sloths endangered. Deforestation has made it easier for predators to spot sloths. The more trees are cut down, the more sloths will get eaten, continuing to decrease their population.  p 
 p 	The pygmy sloth has survived in the red mangrove forest of Isla Escudo de Veraguas for thousands of years with very little disruption to its habitat. However, development and other human causes are now contributing to their endangerment.   p
