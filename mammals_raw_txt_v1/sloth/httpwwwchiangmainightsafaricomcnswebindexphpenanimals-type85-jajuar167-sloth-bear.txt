 p Melursus ursinus is a mammal in the family Ursidae, indigenous in the lowland forests of countries such as India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It is the only bear species of the genus Melursus, formerly classified as bear sloth because of its sickle-shaped claws and its tendency to spend most of its time in trees and bushes, same as the sloth. It has been classified as a bear since the 1800’s. br 
The sloth bear is similar in appearance to the Malayan sun bear with a body length of 150-190 cm., long coats of light or reddish brown or sometimes black, with a whitish V-shaped mark on its chest and long white muzzle. The lips are stretched from the gum and it has no upper incisors as part of its evolution as insectivorous. Its long curved claws allow it to dig and climb very well and it leaves footprints similar to human’s. Males are larger than females and weigh approximately 80-140 kg. compared with females which weigh 55-95 kg. The sloth bear has the longest tail in the bear family and also has a long lifespan, living up to 40 years in captivity. br 
In addition to being an excellent climber and spending most of its time in trees, it can also jump as far as up to 10 feet and hang upside down like sloths. It clearly marks its territory by rubbing its sides against trees or clawing tree barks. It has good sensory perceptions, especially its sense of smell and hearing. It can hear sounds of up to 100 feet away. br 
The sloth bear is nocturnal and sleeps during the day. Its main diet consists of ants and termites, using its claws to destroy molehills. Other foods include honey, egg, flowers, fruit, meat and other grains.  p
