 p class="product__short-description" The sloth spends almost its entire life in the trees of tropical rainforests.  p 
 p class="product__long-description" The sloth spends almost its entire life in the trees of tropical rainforests. Its curved claws give it a firm grip on the branches of the trees. Since it always hangs from the branches upside down, the sloth’s fur grows from its belly towards its back, instead of growing from its back or head. This allows rainwater to drain away better.   p 
 p A sloth’s claws look like meathooks and grow to a length of 10–12 cm.   p
