 p Set between tropical Caribbean and Pacific coasts, Costa Rica is one of the most breathtaking countries in the world. Even though it covers just 0.03% of the world’s landmass, it is home to an incredible 500,000 species including jaguars, sloths, spider monkeys and five species of turtle.  p 
 p Join this incredible project to experience front line conservation and help safeguard Costa Rica’s precious wildlife and unique habitats for future generations. The rescue centre has been set up to provide a sanctuary for animals that have either been rescued from captivity or found injured. At the centre you will have the opportunity to work hands on with these incredible animals and help improve their lives. Once at the centre they are given superb care and attention in an effort to rebuild their fragile lives, and where possible are re-introduced back into the wild.  p 
 p WHAT DOES THE PROJECT DO?  p 
 p Human encroachment and activities, both legal and illegal, have resulted in the steady decline of many of Costa Rica’s most defining species. Animals which have been recovered from poachers need to be cared for before being reintroduced to the wild, if they even can be. Volunteering at an animal rescue centre could be your opportunity to contribute to the care and possible rehabilitation of any number of species, while getting up close and personal in the process.  p 
 p The Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center and Sanctuary is a privately owned wildlife rescue facility focusing on the care, rehabilitation and study of Costa Rican wildlife. We work directly with the government receiving confiscated, sick and injured wild animals. All the animals that come to our rescue center receive all the medical attention and love needed. We are able to release many back into the wild however those who can’t, stay in the center. These animals accomplish a mission in life, they help us in our education programmes so that everyone can learn to respect nature. Although we work with the government we do not receive governmental support, we rely on our membership programme, private donations and international volunteers for their contribution to this amazing project.  p 
 p The kinds of animals that can typically be expected at the sanctuary include sloths, white-faced, howler and spider monkeys, toucans, parrots, kinkajous and olingo.  p 
 p Working alongside local staff, volunteers help look after the animals and educate visitors. At the centre volunteers may have the opportunity to work hands on with monkeys, sloths, racoons and other wildlife.  p 
 p You will be involved in every aspect of the day to day running of the centre, including feeding the animals and preparing the food, cleaning the enclosures, building and repairing the enclosures and feeding platforms. Your experience here will enrich your knowledge and your expertise on wild animal care.  p 
 p A typical day at the rescue center could consist of the following:  p 
 p 7am: Breakfast  p 
 p 8am: Morning meeting to allocate chores  p
