	Set between tropical Caribbean and Pacific coasts, Costa Rica is one of the most breathtaking countries in the world. Even though it covers just 0.03% of the world’s landmass, it is home to an incredible 500,000 species including jaguars, sloths, spider monkeys and five species of turtle. br

	oin this incredible project to experience front line conservation and help safeguard Costa Rica's precious wildlife and unique habitats for future generations. The rescue centre has been set up to provide a sanctuary for animals that have either been rescued from captivity or found injured. At the centre you will have the opportunity to work hands on with these incredible animals and help improve their lives. Once at the centre they are given superb care and attention in an effort to rebuild their fragile lives, and where possible are re-introduced back into the wild.  p

	Human encroachment and activities, both legal and illegal, have resulted in the steady decline of many of Costa Rica's most defining species. Animals which have been recovered from poachers need to be cared for before being reintroduced to the wild, if they even can be. Volunteering at an animal rescue centre could be your opportunity to contribute to the care and possible rehabilitation of any number of species, while getting up close and personal in the process.  p 
 p 
	The Costa Rica Animal Rescue Center and Sanctuary is a privately owned wildlife rescue facility focusing on the care, rehabilitation and study of Costa Rican wildlife. We work directly with the government receiving confiscated, sick and injured wild animals. All the animals that come to our rescue center receive all the medical attention and love needed. We are able to release many back into the wild however those who can't, stay in the center. These animals accomplish a mission in life, they help us in our education programmes so that everyone can learn to respect nature. Although we work with the government we do not receive governmental support, we rely on our membership programme, private donations and international volunteers for their contribution to this amazing project.   p 
 p 
	The kinds of animals that can typically be expected at the sanctuary include sloths, white-faced, howler and spider monkeys, toucans, parrots, kinkajous and olingo.  p 
 p 
	Working alongside local staff, volunteers help look after the animals and educate visitors. At the centre volunteers may have the opportunity to work hands on with monkeys, sloths and other wildlife.  p 
 p 
	You will be involved in every aspect of the day to day running of the centre, including feeding the animals and preparing the food, cleaning the enclosures, building and repairing the enclosures and feeding platforms. Your experience here will enrich your knowledge and your expertise on wild animal care.  p 
 p 
	At the rescue center everyone is expected to pull their own weight and work together as a team and take responsibility for the daily duties looking after the animals. The animals do not work on our schedule, rather they follow their own internal clock which insists that they eat early in the day. The time for your rest and relaxation is later in the day when high temperatures usually demand it.  p 
 p 
	A typical day at the rescue center could consist of the following:  p 
 p 
	7am: Breakfast  p 
 p 
	8am: Morning meeting to allocate chores  p 
 p 
	8am-11am: Morning chores: cleaning enclosures, preparing food, babysitting, etc.  p 
 p 
	12pm: Lunch  p 
 p 
	1pm: Lunch meeting to allocate afternoon chores  p 
 p 
	1pm-3pm: Afternoon chores: continued duties around the sanctuary as required such as cleaning, sweeping, enclosure maintenance.  p 
 p 
	3pm-6pm: Relaxation, reading, swimming, individual projects, free time.  p 
 p

 p 
	Upon your arrival to Juan Santa Maria International Airport in San Jose you should make your way to the project site, the address is indicated in your field brief.  Please be aware that you will also be responsible for organising your own transport from the project site back to San Jose airport at the end of your project. This is pretty straightforward and your volunteer coordinator will be more than happy to help you with your own arrangements.  p 
 p 
	Throughout your stay on the project you will be living in shared dormitory style accommodation at the biological centre, with volunteer common room and communal kitchen. You will be provided with a mosquito net, bed sheets and a laundry service once a week. Although basic, your accommodation will of course be clean and comfortable and you will soon feel at home with your welcoming hosts.  p 
 p 
	While you are on the project, all meals are included in the programme (breakfast, lunch and dinner).  These will be based upon a typical Costa Rican diet.  Your food will be fairly basic and consist mainly of rice, beans, corn, meat, pasta, vegetables and seasonal fruits, as well as plenty of gallo pinto.  p

	You will have one day off per week, which can be arranged with the centre's administration. San José is situated in the middle of the country making it a convenient location for travelling to other parts of Costa Rica. In San José you will find buses that will take you directly to the Caribbean coast, the Pacific coast, the famous Arenal volcano, Monteverde Cloud Forest, Manuel Antonio National Park and many other destinations.  p 
 p 
	There are many interesting sights and activities on the Carribean coast such as the tourist hub of Puerto Viejo, Tortuguero and Cahuita National Park for incredible wildlife viewing, Uvita Island for relaxing days off and even ziplining and river rafting opportunities nearby for the adrenaline seekers amongst you!  p 
 p 
	Alternatively many of our volunteers have also helped out at one of the local schools and donated their day off to this incredibly rewarding experience. Please ask your in-country coordinator for more information if this is something that you would be interested in.  p
