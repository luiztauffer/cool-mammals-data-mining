 p If there’s any animal that visitors want to see in Costa Rica, it’s the sloth. The sloths in Costa Rica have become the symbol of the country due to its oh-so-adorable face, snuggly body and very pura vida lifestyle.  p 
 p If it’s your life goal to see one of these precious  em perezosos  em  during your trip to Costa Rica, it’s best to do a bit of research about them first. Sloths are common in Costa Rica but not so common that you’ll see them everywhere all the time. Since they camouflage themselves so well, you could walk past a handful of them and never notice!  p 
 p So here I answer the question that many of you ask:  em where to see sloths in Costa Rica?  em   p 
 p There are two species of sloths in Costa Rica: the Brown-throated sloth, a species of 3 toed sloth and the Hoffman’s two-toed sloth. Both of these can be seen in Costa Rica. The technically correct name to call them are 3-fingered and 2-fingered as both sloths have 3 toes in their hind feet.  p 
 p This two-fingered sloth is largely nocturnal, so it’s harder to see them than the 3-fingered sloth. If you do see them, they will most likely be sound asleep.  p 
 p Their two front feet have two toes, each with a set of long curved claws. However, their hind feet have three toes. They differ from the 3-fingered sloth by their longer snout, separate front toes, larger size and no hair on the soles of the feet.  p 
 p Two-toed fingered live in dry forests, humid forests, riparian forests and old secondary forests. In Costa Rica, they live in forests up to 3000 meters in elevation.  p 
 p Places they’ve been commonly spotted:  p 
 p The Brown-throated sloth is the most common of the 3-fingered sloth species. All of their feet have 3 fingers with long claws. They have a round head and a short nose.  p 
 p They sleep around 15 hours and are active both day and night.  p 
 p They are found in pretty much the same areas as the two-fingered sloth, but they are easier to spot. When the two sloths overlap in habitat, the Brown-throated tends to be of smaller size and more numerous, as they are more active than the two-fingered sloths.  p 
 p  em 3-fingered sloth are not found in the Monteverde or high elevation areas. They don’t have as much fur as the 2-fingered sloth and can’t survive in colder climates.  em   p 
 p If you absolutely have to see a sloth, then the best option is to visit a wildlife refuge or sanctuary. Please note that you cannot pet, touch or hold sloths in Costa Rica. No “sanctuary” should allow you to do this as it is extremely bad for the sloth’s health since they get very stressed out and humans can transmit bacteria and other harmful things.  p 
 p In these centers, you will see only 2-fingered sloths since they are easier to rehabilitate and keep in captivity due to their diet. 2 fingered sloths have a more variable diet (leaves, fruits, insects) whereas 3-fingered sloths eat strictly leaves.  p 
 p These centers work to rehabilitate and release the sloths back into the wild.  p 
 p  strong  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com activities jaguar-rescue-center-puerto-viejo " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Jaguar Rescue Center  a :  strong  This rescue center helps and rehabilitates all sorts of animals, including sloths. Located in the Caribbean, part of the La Ceiba wildlife refuge by Puerto Viejo de Talamanca.  p 
 p  strong Toucan Rescue Ranch:   strong This rescue ranch is in Heredia and rescues and rehabilitates wildlife. However, many of their animals are permanent residents as they were too injured to be released or were unable to survive in the wild on their own.  p 
 p These sloths are permanent residents as they are unable to survive in the wild (kept as pets, born in captivity, etc.)  p 
 p  strong  a href="https:  www.hotelscombined.com Hotel The_Springs_Resort_Spa_at_Arenal.htm?a_aid=95665" target="_blank" rel="noopener" Springs Resort &amp; Spa  a :   strong This hotel in Arenal has a small animal sanctuary with 2-fingered sloths. Newly renovated.  p 
 p  strong  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com hotels-in-costa-rica peace-lodge-la-paz-waterfall-gardens " target="_blank" rel="noopener" La Paz Waterfall Gardens  a :  strong  They have a couple 2-fingered sloths in the waterfall park in Vara Blanca. (Get 10% off the gardens entrance fee)  p 
 p  strong  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com activities diamante-eco-adventure-park " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Diamante Adventure Park  a :  strong  This adventure park by the RIU Guanacaste (Gulf of Papagayo) has a animal sanctuary with two fingered sloths. (Get 10% off the park entrance in the link!)  p 
 p  strong **Not a rescue center or refugee** The Sloth Institute:   strong Non profit dedicated to conservation and education on sloths. Their main goal is to release sloths back in the wild. Though they aren’t open to the public, if you want to learn more about sloths, they are the place to ask. They do a  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com activities the-sloth-institute " sloth walk  a  on the  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com hotels-in-costa-rica tulemar-vacation-rentals-resort-manuel-antonio " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Tulemar  a  property in Manuel Antonio every day which is only open to Tulemar guests (we saw 10 sloths when we were there!)  p 
 p  strong The best way to see a sloth in the wild is to hire a naturalist guide.  strong  They are trained to see sloths, since they are extremely good at camouflaging themselves and they will have binoculars and telescopes to find them.  p 
 p The first time I ever saw a sloth in the wild was thanks to a guide who was nice enough to point out to everyone the two-fingered sloth sleeping high in the trees. Sloth sightings were all thanks to the guide and their sharp eyes!  p 
 p  strong Sloths are easier to see in Central and South Pacific and the Caribbean due to the high humidity and lush rainforest all year round.  strong   p 
 p The best places to see sloths in Costa Rica are Puerto Viejo, Tortuguero,  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com costa-rica-national-park manuel-antonio-national-park-costa-rica " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Manuel Antonio  a , Uvita, Dominical and the Osa Peninsula. You can see them in the treetops on the side of the road, crossing the road or snoozing in palm trees on the beach!  p 
 p It’s harder to see sloths in Guanacaste and the Pacific coast as it is too dry for them. There are no sloths on the beaches or coasts of the Pacific, you will need to go inland to the rainforests to see them. If you’re super ducky crazy lucky, you  em may  em  see a sloth in Rincon de la Vieja or Santa Rosa National Parks but that is extremely rare.  p 
 p  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com cities-costa-rica la-fortuna-de-san-carlos-a-real-fortune-in-nature " target="_blank" rel="noopener" La Fortuna  a  and  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com cities-costa-rica bijagua-costa-rica-rio-celeste " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Bijagua  a  are your best options to see sloths in the wild from Guanacaste. We saw two sloths on  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com hotels-in-costa-rica casitas-tenorio-hotel-near-rio-celeste " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Casitas Tenorio’s  a  property in Bijagua (about 2.5 hour drive from Tamarindo, 1.5 from Liberia). They have a very short trail through their property where two and three fingered sloths live. In La Fortuna, the best option is the Bogarin Trail, which I’ll talk about more below.  p 
 p There are a lot of sloths in the La Fortuna and Arenal area but not in the Arenal Volcano National Park. You will need to look in the primary and secondary rainforests in the area. It may seem like there aren’t any sloths there but you just need to know where to look.  p 
 p The best place to see sloths in La Fortuna is at the  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com activities bogarin-trail-la-fortuna-sloth-tour " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Bogarin Trail  a  right in town. It is a restored secondary forest and there are around 25 sloths on the property. Take a guided walk to see around 5 to 6 sloths in an hour!  p 
 p Only the 2-fingered sloth lives in Monteverde due to the cold climate and since these sloths are mostly nocturnal, it is harder to see sloths in Monteverde for this reason.  p 
 p You may be able to see one on a  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com activities monteverde-night-walk-finca-santamaria " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Monteverde night walk  a  or in the forests in the area. A lot of people see sloths on the power lines in Monteverde too.  p 
 p Many hotels in Costa Rica have wild sloths on the property. We have seen sloths at the  a href="https:  www.hotelscombined.com Hotel Nayara_Hotel_Spa_and_Gardens.htm?a_aid=95665" target="_blank" rel="noopener" Nayara Hotel  a  in La Fortuna,  a href="https:  www.hotelscombined.com Hotel Hotel_Cuna_del_Angel.htm?a_aid=95665" target="_blank" rel="noopener" Hotel Cuna del Angel  a  in Dominical,  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com hotels-in-costa-rica hotel-banana-azul-puerto-viejo " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Hotel Banana Azul  a  in Puerto Viejo,  a href="https:  mytanfeet.com activities tortuguero-packages " target="_blank" rel="noopener" Evergreen and Aninga Lodge  a  in Tortuguero, and Tulemar in Manuel Antonio.  p 
 p So if you really want to see a sloth in the wild, you can also book a hotel that has sloths on their property! (Read reviews to see what people say).  p

 p Hi there..!  p 
 p  There is a new option in Arenal where people can take a tour with a trained naturalist guide to find sloths in the wild. This is a company call Callidryas tours who has done a little reserach about the sloth population in the area and can take you to the places where you get a  guarranty you see them in the wild, it has also a very professional staff with a really good optic equipment to enjoy the best views of this beautiful animals. I know there are places in Costa Rica where people can find them sometimes without a tour. But this tour is an option if you wanna make sure and don`t miss them while visit Costa Rica.  p

You can google it to read more stories and get more information, Yeison used to go there with student groups and witnessed it himself.

 p Hi Samantha and Yeison, br 
Always nice to read your article, gives good pointers in what direction to start! br 
A little question: Will be around Manuel Antonio and looking to hire a guide, would you have any suggestions of a good person to guide us? br 
Also thinking visiting Los Quetzales National Park, and maybe getting a guide as well, if you had any suggestions for that area as well?  p 
 p Thank you very for taking time to share your experiences  p

 p Hi Pierre, you can find guides in front of the national park entrance and they will come up to you and ask if you want a guide. We have never hired a guide to Manuel Antonio but make sure the guide is ICT certified. You can also book a guide with tour companies in the area like Iguana Tours if you feel more comfortable going with a company.   p 
 p As for Los Quetzales, it’s not a super popular park so I would see if you can book a tour with your hotel if you’re staying in the area.  p

 p These guys really are great to see in the wild – one of our favourite spots was El Ceibo in the province of Limon.  This is a very popular restaurant stop for tours travelling between San Jose and Tortuguero which has the added bonus of being home to a great population of Blue Jean Dart Frogs!  p
