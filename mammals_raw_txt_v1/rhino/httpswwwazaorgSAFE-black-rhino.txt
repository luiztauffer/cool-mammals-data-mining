 p Between 2010-2014 alone, 78 AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums reported investing over $4.2 million towards rhinoceros conservation - with more than $1.5 million directly benefiting black rhinos. The AZA community supported organizations such as the International Rhino Foundation, a charity dedicated to the global conservation of rhinos through allocation of funds towards projects and species in need. In addition, for over two decades, AZA-accredited institutions have provided financial support to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, through the American Association of Zoo Keepers Bowling for Rhinos program. Lewa is home to 12% of Kenya's black rhino population, making it an integral partner to AZA-accredited zoos and aquariums that are dedicated to rhino conservation.  p
