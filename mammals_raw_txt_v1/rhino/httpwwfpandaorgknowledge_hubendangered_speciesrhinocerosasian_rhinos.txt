 p There are three Asian rhino species, all of which have been pushed to the brink of extinction. The greater one-horned is slowly recovering thanks to years of succesful conservation efforts but the Sumatran and Javan rhinos remain at great risk. br 
 br 
Having once roamed across most of Asia, they’re now found in the wild in just four countries - India, Nepal, Bhutan and Indonesia. Poaching for their horns and habitat loss are the two greatest threats to the survival of Asia's remaining rhinos.  p

 p The greatest threat to Asian rhino populations is  strong poaching  strong . For centuries, powdered horn has been used in traditional Asian medicine in the belief that it can treat ailments ranging from hangovers and fevers to cancer. br 
 br 
Horns are also purchased and consumed purely as a symbol of wealth and social status. The current demand for rhino horn is primarily in Vietnam. As a result, poachers continue to kill the animals to take the horn, despite increased surveillance and protection. br 
 br 
Asian rhinos are also threatened by  strong habitat loss   strong and the degradation of their forest, grassland and marshland habitat – mainly due to human settlements, logging and agriculture. They now survive mainly in small, isolated areas – in small populations that can be prone to inbreeding. br 
 br 
The growing human population is putting more pressure on rhino habitat. As their living space contracts, rhinos increasingly come into contact - and conflict - with people. Rhinos have destroyed crops and caused some human casualties, and humans have retaliated. br 
 br 
Habitat loss not only reduces the available living space for rhinos, but also isolates and fragments rhino herds, making reproduction and genetic mixing more difficult.  p
