 p class="excerpt" On World Rhino Day we report on the medical claims made by the sellers of rhino horn powder and the studies that prove you would be better off with an aspirin or biting your nails.  p 
 p class="editor-name" Researched by Ruth Becker  p 
 p According to the people who sell it in the markets of East Asia, powdered rhino horn can serve as everything from a cure for cancer to an all-purpose health tonic, a sexual stimulant, a hangover cure and a treatment for high fever.  p 
 p Though scoffed at by many in the West, the claims of ‘medicinal powers’ that are made by the sellers of rhino horn matter because,  a href="http:  www.traffic.org species-reports traffic_species_mammals66.pdf" widely believed in the region  a , they explain the continuing demand for rhino horn products that is decimating the world’s dwindling rhino population.  p 
 p As of today –  a href="http:  www.worldrhinoday.org " World Rhino Day  a  – more than 400 rhino have been killed for their horn in South Africa alone since January. While ten years ago, a mere 25 rhinos were poached a year, the number taken in 2011 reached 448, and this year the number poached as at 21 September stood at 430, according to the Department of Environmental Affairs strong .  strong   p

According to  a href="http:  www.traffic.org species-reports traffic_species_mammals66.pdf" researchers  a  however, the baseless claim is now gaining ground in Vietnamese society.  p 
 p Wider medicinal claims for rhino horn are not new, however. According to traditional Chinese texts, such as Li Shih-chen’s 1597 medical text “Pen Ts’ ao Kang Mu”, rhino horn has been used in Chinese medicine for more than 2000 years for a variety of ailments ranging from poisoning to hallucinations, typhoid to carbuncles and boils.  p 
 p And since we know that traditional medicines often do have some basis in science, could that be the case here?  p 
 p Speaking at a meeting of the  a href="http:  www.cawtglobal.org " Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking  a  in Johannesburg last year,  a href="http:  www.traffic.org species-reports traffic_species_mammals66.pdf" Vietnamese officials confirmed  a  that rhino horn was often sold – and bought – in Vietnam as a treatment for cancer and other serious ailments.  p 
 p Lixin Huang, president of the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said the overwhelming demand derived from claims it could act as a cure for cancer.  p 
 p This was despite the studies that showed no link between taking rhino horn and curing cancer. “Rhino horn is no longer approved for use by the Traditional Chinese Medicine profession and there is no traditional use, nor any evidence for the effectiveness of, rhino horn as a cure for cancer,”  a href="http:  www.asianscientist.com topnews wwf-traditional-chinese-medicine-rhino-horn-cancer-cure-cites-meeting " she said  a .  p 
 p There is no evidence that rhino horn is an effective cure for cancer and this is not documented in TCM nor is it approved by the clinical research in traditional Chinese medicine.”  p 
 p  a href="http:  www.traffic.org species-reports traffic_species_mammals66.pdf" According to Tom Milliken  a  of wildlife monitoring group TRAFFIC, this makes the claims made by the sellers simply a “cynical marketing ploy to increase the profitability of the illicit trade by targeting desperate, and often dying, people”.  p

 p Research into the claims that rhino and other horn were effective in reducing fever was carried out by Swiss pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-LaRoche in the 1980s and published in The Environmentalist in 1983. It was followed up by researchers at the Chinese University in Hong Kong, published in  the  a href="http:  www.rhinoresourcecenter.com pdf_files 117 1178933681.pdf" Journal of Ethnopharmacaology, 30 (1990) 157 – 168  a ,  and all reported  negative  results.  p 
 p After administering over  100-fold the  normal  human  oral  dose to fever-induced rats, the  a href="http:  newswatch.nationalgeographic.com 2010 07 07 rhino_horn_and_traditional_chinese_medicine_facts " Hong Kong university studies found  a  that “rhinoceros  horn  can  reduce fever,  but  only  at  rather  high  dosage  levels  when  prescribed  as  a  single drug”.  p 
 p Since then, Rhishja Larson, programme director of Saving Rhinos LLC, a campaigning group,  a href="http:  newswatch.nationalgeographic.com 2010 07 07 rhino_horn_and_traditional_chinese_medicine_facts " claimed that  a  “rhino horn, like fingernails, is made of agglutinated hair” and “has no analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmolytic nor diuretic properties” and “no bactericidal effect could be found against suppuration and intestinal bacteria”.  p 
 p In other words, it doesn’t work against pain, inflammation, muscle spasm, stomach ailments or cleaning up wounds.  p

 p “There are three research findings that show fever reducing responses in children, so there is something there – some minor effect,” he said.  p 
 p Or to put it another way,  a href="http:  newswatch.nationalgeographic.com 2010 07 07 rhino_horn_and_traditional_chinese_medicine_facts " Dr Raj Amin at the Zoological Society of London  a , said: “Medically, it’s the same as if you were chewing your own nails.”  p 
 p Since the claims that it is a sexual stimulant are only generally believed in the West, and biting your nails is not going to generate much revenue, if the public in East Asia were to accept the scientific studies, rhino horn sales might finally start to fall.  p

 p Thank you for the work you do.  p 
 p Im glad someone finall did the work and gave the full and correct information on this topic.  p 
 p A use which I have been told about but never seen reported is that powdered horn is not used as an aphrodisiac per se, but is sprinkled on the genitals to provide a tingling sensation during sex. I cannot document this, but the Chinese person who explained it to me did so matter-of-factly, as if everyone knew this. If this turns out to be true, and was properly reported in the west, then I think it could go a long way to help shame some of the end market countries into doing more to curb trafficking.  p 
 p The uneducated human that uses animal parts for medicinal purpose is a sad frightening reality in this world. As our exotic wild life rapidly reaches extinction, there is no one to blame except the human race. We are responsible for the extinction of numerous animal species. Yet we have not learned the lesson. br 
Greed and profit is the driving force in this century. We can no longer blame ignorance for this. But not only do they seek these magnificent creatures for medical remedies but also for trophies. br 
What are these hunters lacking in their life that they feel the need to kill? As I see the horror of the dead animal and them posing with their kill, far to often thanks to social networking, they have this look of pride on their faces. What are they so proud of? That you just killed a defenseless animall? Shame to them. Yet they feel nothing. Pitiful, selfish human.  p 
 p I am wondering, what culture in the western world, spread the fact that its an aphrodisiac? I would be very interested to know, as then it is those people who need to carry a massive % of blame, for the continued decimation of our rhino!!!  p 
 p STOP STOP KILLING RHINO’S  p 
 p that too bad, always wanted to hunt one myself. i hope they bring them back with cloning, and i will be able to realise my dream, to hunt white rino.  p 
 p I wonder if those Asians will ever get the drift though.  p 
 p Helping the Rhino is going for a good cause keep up the good work camille hyde  p
