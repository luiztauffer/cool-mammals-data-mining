The living species fall into three categories. The two African species, the  a href=" wiki White_rhinoceros" title="White rhinoceros" white rhinoceros  a  and the  a href=" wiki Black_rhinoceros" title="Black rhinoceros" black rhinoceros  a , belong to the tribe Dicerotini, which originated in the middle  a href=" wiki Miocene" title="Miocene" Miocene  a , about 14.2 million years ago. The species diverged during the early  a href=" wiki Pliocene" title="Pliocene" Pliocene  a  (about 5 million years ago). The main difference between black and white rhinos is the shape of their mouths – white rhinos have broad flat lips for grazing, whereas black rhinos have long pointed lips for eating foliage. There are two living Rhinocerotini species, the  a href=" wiki Indian_rhinoceros" title="Indian rhinoceros" Indian rhinoceros  a  and the  a href=" wiki Javan_rhinoceros" title="Javan rhinoceros" Javan rhinoceros  a , which diverged from one another about 10 million years ago.

As of 2013, the southern subspecies has a wild population of 20,405 – making them the most abundant rhino subspecies in the world. However, the northern subspecies is critically endangered, with all that is known to remain being two captive females. There is no conclusive explanation of the name "white rhinoceros".

 p The white rhino has an immense body and large head, a short neck and broad chest. Females weigh 1,600 kg (4,000 lb) and males 2,400 kg (5,000 lb). The head-and-body length is 3.5–4.6 m (11–15 ft) and the shoulder height is 1.8–2 m (5.9–6.6 ft). On its snout it has two  a href=" wiki Horn_(anatomy)" title="Horn (anatomy)" horns  a . The front horn is larger than the other horn and averages 90 cm (35 in) in length and can reach 150 cm (59 in). The white rhinoceros also has a prominent muscular hump that supports its relatively large head. The colour of this animal can range from yellowish brown to slate grey. Most of its body hair is found on the ear fringes and tail bristles, with the rest distributed rather sparsely over the rest of the body. White rhinos have the distinctive flat broad mouth that is used for grazing. sup id="cite_ref-skinner_10-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-skinner-10" [10]  a   sup

 p The name "black rhinoceros" ( i  a href=" wiki Diceros_bicornis" class="mw-redirect" title="Diceros bicornis" Diceros bicornis  a   i ) was chosen to distinguish this species from the white rhinoceros ( i  a href=" wiki Ceratotherium_simum" class="mw-redirect" title="Ceratotherium simum" Ceratotherium simum  a   i ). This can be confusing, as the two species are not truly distinguishable by color.

Due to habitat loss and  a href=" wiki Poaching" title="Poaching" poaching  a , their numbers have declined and it has become the most threatened rhinoceros. About 275 Sumatran rhinos are believed to remain. There are three subspecies of Sumatran rhinoceros: the  a href=" wiki Sumatran_rhinoceros" title="Sumatran rhinoceros" Sumatran rhinoceros  a  proper ( i Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis  i ), the  a href=" wiki Bornean_rhinoceros" title="Bornean rhinoceros" Bornean rhinoceros  a  ( i Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni  i ) and the possibly  a href=" wiki Extinction" title="Extinction" extinct  a   a href=" wiki Northern_Sumatran_rhinoceros" title="Northern Sumatran rhinoceros" Northern Sumatran rhinoceros  a  ( i Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis  i ).

Like the  a href=" wiki Africa" title="Africa" African  a  species, it has two horns; the larger is the front (25–79 centimetres (9.8–31.1 in)), with the smaller usually less than 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long. Males have much larger horns than the females. Hair can range from dense (the densest hair in young calves) to sparse. The color of these rhinos is reddish brown. The body is short and has stubby legs. The lip is  a href=" wiki Prehensility" title="Prehensility" prehensile  a .
