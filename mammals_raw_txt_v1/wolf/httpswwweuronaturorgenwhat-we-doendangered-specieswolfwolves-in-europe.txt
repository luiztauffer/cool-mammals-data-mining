 p Mankind's relationship to the  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf fact-sheet-wolf " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" wolf  a  is ambivalent – on the one hand the animal is admired as a skilled and untiring hunter but also ill-famed as Isengrim the bloodthirsty and persecuted. In many parts of  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe projects " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" Europe  a  these once common grey-coated raiders have long disappeared. EuroNatur is collaborating with internationally recognized  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf fact-sheet-wolf " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" wolf  a  experts and selected partners in promoting ways to make it possible for  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf fact-sheet-wolf " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" wolves  a  to re-establish themselves in  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe projects " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" Europe  a  again.  p 
 p  b What are the threats to wolves in Europe?  b   p 
 p  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf fact-sheet-wolf " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" Wolves  a  are highly adaptable and could in fact flourish in a variety of  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf fact-sheet-wolf #c8289" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" habitats  a . However in the course of centuries they have been driven back into more and more remote wooded areas. In many countries they have been mercilessly hunted and finally wiped out. Although today the  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf fact-sheet-wolf " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" wolf  a  is granted highest protection status in many EU countries there are still repeated incidents of wolves being shot. In addition the increasing fragmentation of the countryside through the construction of roads, housing developments and the intensification of farming methods all pose problems for their survival.  p 
 p  b In which regions is EuroNatur campaigning for the interests of wolves?  b   p 
 p Today there are still considerable wolf populations for example in Eastern  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe " title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link" Europe  a  and in the Balkans. This is why the main focus of our work is on  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe projects protecting-wolves-in-poland " Poland  a ,  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe projects protecting-wolves-in-bulgaria " Bulgaria  a  and  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe projects protecting-wolves-in-croatia " Croatia  a . But we also support the successful return of the wolf in  a href=" en what-we-do endangered-species wolf wolves-in-europe projects protecting-wolves-in-germany " Germany  a .   p

                            Lithe and skillful, the lynx is a shy, lone hunter. If it is to survive in Europe and if the population is to be undisturbed enough to increase in number, intensive protection measures will be required.
