 p  strong  span id="ref1150508"   span Gray wolf  strong ,  ( em Canis lupus  em ), also called  strong timber wolf  strong ,  largest wild member of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal dog" class="md-crosslink" dog  a  family ( a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal canine" class="md-crosslink" Canidae  a ). It inhabits vast areas of the Northern Hemisphere. Between 5 and 24 subspecies of gray wolves are recognized in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place North-America" class="md-crosslink" North America  a  and 7 to 12 are recognized in Eurasia, with 1 in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Africa" class="md-crosslink" Africa  a .  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal wolf" class="md-crosslink" Wolves  a  were  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science domestication" class="md-crosslink" domesticated  a  several thousand years ago, and selective breeding produced  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal dog" class="md-crosslink" dogs  a .  p

 p Keen senses, large  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science canine-tooth" class="md-crosslink" canine teeth  a , powerful  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science jaw" class="md-crosslink" jaws  a , and the ability to pursue prey at 60 km (37 miles) per hour equip the gray  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal wolf" class="md-crosslink autoxref" wolf  a  well for a predatory way of life. A typical northern male may be about 2 metres (6.6 feet) long, including the bushy half-metre-long tail. Standing 76 cm (30 inches) tall at the shoulder, it weighs about 45 kg (100 pounds), but weight ranges from 14 to 65 kg (31 to 143 pounds), depending on the geographic area. Females average about 20 percent smaller than males. The largest wolves are found in west-central  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Canada" class="md-crosslink" Canada  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Alaska" class="md-crosslink" Alaska  a , and across northern  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Asia" class="md-crosslink" Asia  a . The smallest tend to be near the southern end of their distribution (the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Middle-East" class="md-crosslink" Middle East  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Arabia-peninsula-Asia" class="md-crosslink" Arabia  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place India" class="md-crosslink" India  a ).  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic fur-animal-skin" class="md-crosslink" Fur  a  on the upper body, though usually gray, may be brown, reddish, black, or whitish, while the underparts and legs are usually yellow-white. Light-coloured wolves are common in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Arctic" class="md-crosslink" Arctic regions  a .  p 
 p Gray wolves usually live in packs of up to two dozen individuals; packs numbering 6 to 10 are most common. A pack is basically a family group consisting of an adult breeding pair (the alpha male and alpha female) and their offspring of various ages. The ability of wolves to form strong  span id="ref1171657"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic animal-social-behaviour" class="md-crosslink" social bonds  a  with one another is what makes the wolf pack possible. A  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science dominance-hierarchy" class="md-crosslink" dominance hierarchy  a  is established within the pack, which helps maintain order. The alpha male and alpha female continually assert themselves over their subordinates, and they guide the activities of the group. The female predominates in roles such as care and defense of pups, whereas the male predominates in foraging and food provisioning and in travels associated with those activities. Both sexes are very active in attacking and killing prey, but during the summer hunts are often conducted alone.  p 
 p A pack’s  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science territory-ecology" class="md-crosslink" territory  a  can be 80 to 3,000 square km (31 to 1,200 square miles), depending on prey abundance, and it is vigorously defended against neighbouring packs. Wolves communicate with one another by visual signaling (facial expression, body position, tail position),  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science vocalization" class="md-crosslink" vocalizations  a , and scent marking. Howling helps the pack stay in contact and also seems to strengthen social bonds among pack members. Along with howling, marking of territory with  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science urine" class="md-crosslink" urine  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science feces" class="md-crosslink" feces  a  lets neighbouring packs know they should not intrude. Intruders are often killed by resident packs, yet in some circumstances they are accepted.  p 
 p Breeding occurs between February and April, and a litter of usually five or six pups is born in the spring after a  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science gestation" class="md-crosslink" gestation  a  period of about two months. The young are usually born in a den consisting of a natural hole or a burrow, often in a hillside. A  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science rock-geology" class="md-crosslink" rock  a  crevice, hollow log, overturned stump, or abandoned  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal beaver" class="md-crosslink" beaver  a  lodge may be used as a den, and even a depression beneath the lower branches of a  a href="https:  www.britannica.com plant conifer" class="md-crosslink" conifer  a  will sometimes  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary suffice" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="suffice" suffice  a . All members of the pack care solicitously for the young. After being weaned from their mother’s milk at six to nine weeks, they are fed a diet of regurgitated  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic meat" class="md-crosslink" meat  a . Throughout  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science spring-season" class="md-crosslink" spring  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science summer-season" class="md-crosslink" summer  a  the pups are the centre of attention as well as the geographic focus of the pack’s activities. After a few weeks the pups are usually moved from the den to an aboveground “rendezvous site,” where they  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic play-behaviour" class="md-crosslink" play  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science sleep" class="md-crosslink" sleep  a  while adults hunt. The pups grow rapidly and are moved farther and more often as summer comes to an end. In  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science autumn-season" class="md-crosslink" autumn  a  the pack starts to travel again within its territory, and the pups must keep up. Most pups are almost adult size by October or November.  p 
 p After two or more years in the pack, many leave to search for a mate, establish a new territory, and possibly even start their own pack. Those who stay with the pack may eventually replace a parent to become a breeding  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal animal" class="md-crosslink" animal  a  (alpha). Large packs seem to result from fewer young wolves’ leaving the group and from litters’ being produced by more than one female. Wolves that leave their packs are known to have traveled as far as 886 km (550 miles).  p 
 p Gray wolves move and hunt mostly at night, especially in areas populated by  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic human-being" class="md-crosslink" humans  a  and during warm  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science weather" class="md-crosslink" weather  a . The main prey are large  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science herbivore" class="md-crosslink" herbivores  a  such as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal deer" class="md-crosslink" deer  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal elk-mammal" class="md-crosslink" elk  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal moose-mammal" class="md-crosslink" moose  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal bison" class="md-crosslink" bison  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal bighorn-sheep" class="md-crosslink" bighorn sheep  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal reindeer" class="md-crosslink autoxref" caribou  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal musk-ox" class="md-crosslink" musk oxen  a , which they chase, seize, and pull to the ground.  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal beaver" class="md-crosslink" Beavers  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal hare-mammal" class="md-crosslink" hares  a  are eaten when available, and wolves in western Canada even fish for Pacific  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal salmon" class="md-crosslink" salmon  a . A large percentage of the animals that wolves kill are young, old, or in poor condition. After making a kill, the pack gorges (consuming some 3 to 9 kg [7 to 20 pounds] per animal) and then lingers, often reducing the carcass to hair and a few  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science bone-anatomy" class="md-crosslink" bones  a  before moving on to look for another meal.  p 
 p Biologists still disagree on the effect wolves have on the size of prey  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science population-biology-and-anthropology" class="md-crosslink" populations  a . Wolves may kill  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal livestock" class="md-crosslink" livestock  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal dog" class="md-crosslink" dogs  a  when they have the opportunity, yet many wolves that live near livestock rarely, if ever, kill them. The number of stock killed in North America is small but increasing as wolves expand their range. By 2018, wolves were thought to be responsible for the losses of hundreds of heads of cattle and other livestock per year in the U.S. To  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary ameliorate" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="ameliorate" ameliorate  a  the concerns of livestock owners and dampen the potential backlash against wolves, several states have programs that compensate livestock owners for the losses to their herds when there is evidence of wolf attacks on their animals. During the 1990s average annual losses to wolves in  span id="ref1171658"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Minnesota" class="md-crosslink" Minnesota  a  were 72  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal cattle-livestock" class="md-crosslink" cattle  a , 33  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal sheep" class="md-crosslink" sheep  a , and 648  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal turkey-bird" class="md-crosslink" turkeys  a , plus a few individuals of other types of livestock. Stock losses are higher in Eurasia. In some areas wolves survive only by killing livestock and eating livestock carrion and human garbage. Nonetheless, wolves usually avoid contact with humans. There have been few  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary substantiated" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="substantiated" substantiated  a  wolf attacks on humans in North America. Such attacks are unusual but have occurred in  span id="ref1171661"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Eurasia" class="md-crosslink" Eurasia  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place India" class="md-crosslink" India  a  and sometimes have resulted in death.  p 
 p Wolves have few natural enemies other than  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic human-being" class="md-crosslink" human beings  a . They can live up to 13 years in the wild, but most die long before that age.  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science disease" class="md-crosslink" Diseases  a  and parasites that can affect wolves include  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science canine-parvovirus-disease" class="md-crosslink" canine parvovirus  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science distemper-disease" class="md-crosslink" distemper  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science rabies" class="md-crosslink" rabies  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science blastomycosis" class="md-crosslink" blastomycosis  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science Lyme-disease" class="md-crosslink" Lyme disease  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal louse" class="md-crosslink" lice  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science mange" class="md-crosslink" mange  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science heartworm-disease" class="md-crosslink" heartworm  a . In most areas of the world, humans are the leading cause of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science death" class="md-crosslink" death  a  for wolves. In areas of high wolf density and declining prey populations, the major causes of death are killing by other wolves and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science starvation" class="md-crosslink" starvation  a .  p

Early human societies that hunted for survival admired the wolf and tried to imitate its habits, but in recent centuries the wolf has been widely viewed as an evil creature, a danger to humans (especially in Eurasia), a competitor for big  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic game-meat" class="md-crosslink" game  a  animals, and a threat to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal livestock" class="md-crosslink" livestock  a . Depredation of livestock was the primary justification for  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary eradicating" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="eradicating" eradicating  a  the wolf from virtually all of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place United-States" class="md-crosslink" United States  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Mexico" class="md-crosslink" Mexico  a , and most of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Europe" class="md-crosslink" Europe  a . Wolves in the  span id="ref1171660"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place United-States" class="md-crosslink" United States  a  were killed by every method imaginable in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and by 1950 they remained only in the northeastern corner of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Minnesota" class="md-crosslink" Minnesota  a . In the late 20th century and early 21st century, greater tolerance, legal protection, and other factors allowed their range to expand in portions of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place North-America" class="md-crosslink" North America  a  and Europe.  p 
 p  Wolves are probably more popular with the public now than at any other time in recorded history. In 1995 wolves from  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Canada" class="md-crosslink" Canada  a  were reintroduced to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Yellowstone-National-Park" class="md-crosslink" Yellowstone National Park  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Idaho" class="md-crosslink" Idaho  a , and captive-reared Mexican wolves (a subspecies) were released to their former range in eastern  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Arizona-state" class="md-crosslink" Arizona  a  beginning in 1998. At the beginning of the 21st century, an estimated 65,000–78,000 wolves inhabited North America.  span id="ref1171659"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Canada" class="md-crosslink" Canada  a  had the largest  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science population-biology-and-anthropology" class="md-crosslink" population  a  (although the provinces of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place New-Brunswick-province" class="md-crosslink" New Brunswick  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Nova-Scotia" class="md-crosslink" Nova Scotia  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Prince-Edward-Island" class="md-crosslink" Prince Edward Island  a  had no wolves), followed by  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Alaska" class="md-crosslink" Alaska  a  and Minnesota. Some of the western states as well as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Michigan" class="md-crosslink" Michigan  a  and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Wisconsin" class="md-crosslink" Wisconsin  a  have smaller but recovering wolf populations. Canadian wolves are protected only within provincial parks, whereas all wolves in the  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary contiguous" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="contiguous" contiguous  a  United States receive some level of legal protection by federal and state governments; however, the wolf’s protected status in Alaska and the lower 48 states continues to be a matter of much debate. Populations in southern Europe and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Scandinavia" class="md-crosslink" Scandinavia  a  are relatively small but are increasing. The Eurasian population probably exceeds 150,000 and is stable or increasing in most countries, and most afford the wolf some degree of legal protection. Worldwide, wolves still occupy about two-thirds of their former range, but they remain viable and have been classified as a species of least concern by the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic International-Union-for-Conservation-of-Nature" class="md-crosslink" International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources  a  since 1996. Although often thought of as wilderness animals, wolves can and do thrive close to people when they are not excessively persecuted and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic food" class="md-crosslink" food  a  is available.  p
