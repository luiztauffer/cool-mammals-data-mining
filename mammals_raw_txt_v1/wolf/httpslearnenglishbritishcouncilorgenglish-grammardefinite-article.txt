 p Hello Sideout02,  p 
 p The definite article is required. The noun is  em grammar skills  em  and the phrase  em of a child  em  defines which grammar skills, so a definite article is required.  p 
 p If the defining phrase is omitted then we are talking about grammar skills in general and no article is needed:  p 
 p It makes me happy to see young children with (good advanced) grammar skills.  p

 p Hi sam61  p 
 p Presumably here there is one specific way they celebrate their festival (the second bullet point above), though I'd need to know the full context to be completely sure. I expect it's for the reason I've mentioned, though.  p
