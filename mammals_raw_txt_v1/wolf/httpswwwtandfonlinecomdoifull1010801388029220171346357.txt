Rather, we aim to explore certain aspects of Norway's overarching wolf policy. This policy has been characterized by precisely formulated wolf population targets that are strikingly low, given Norway's size, abundance of suitable habitat, and low human population density.

Yet the Norwegian authorities and other stakeholders have long taken the view that it is not. Three arguments in particular have tended to raise their heads in support of this position: (1) the Convention does not prescribe any minimum population level for species; (2) no wolf population increase is required within Norway as long as the Scandinavian population is secure; and (3) Norway has never been formally reprimanded over its wolf policy by the Standing Committee, the treaty body tasked with overseeing the Convention's implementation. A complete analysis of Norway's wolf policy in light of the Bern Convention is beyond the scope of this particular article, and for the present, we limit ourselves to some salient considerations in respect of each of these three arguments.  p

Significantly, the population standard laid down in Article 2 constitutes an  i absolute  i  minimum, as the Convention does not allow for exceptions in respect of Article 2. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0029" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 29  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 29 Article 9 enables derogations only from Articles 4–8.  i See  i  Bowman et al.,  i supra  i  note 7, at 320. Incidentally, it would also seem that parties' obligations under Article 2 cannot be affected by reservations as allowed under Article 22(1). This is a consequence, in particular, of the delimitation made in the latter provision to reservations regarding “species specified in Appendices I to III and or, for certain species mentioned in the reservation …, regarding certain means or methods of killing, capture and other exploitation listed in Appendix IV.” Bern Convention,  i supra  i  note 7, at art. 22(1). Reservations thus presumably affect only the obligations specifically coupled with particular Appendices. As the scope of Article 2 encompasses all native wild flora and fauna species, it would be incongruous to assume that Article 22 would allow for reservations excluding Appendix I–III species from the scope of Article 2 while not allowing for reservations excluding common, unlisted species from the scope of Article 2. Also note that Article 22(1) prohibits “reservations of a general nature.” Id.

Comparable standards would then presumably apply to other Convention parties where wolves occur. Thus Sweden, Germany, and France—all of which have seen the return of wolves in recent decades and all of which now have wolf populations numbering in the hundreds (equivalent to many tens of packs)—could also have drawn the line at six packs when wolf numbers started increasing and still be in line with Article 2 of the Bern Convention. And why indeed would Article 2 stand in the way of countries such as Spain and Romania cutting back their wolf populations—which number in the thousands—to six packs each? Along this line of reasoning, the entire European wolf population west of the Russian border could be reduced to one-eighth of its current size without any violation of Article 2 of the Bern Convention occurring. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0041" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 41  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 41 Twenty-five wolf-hosting Bern Convention parties with six annual reproductions per country amount to 150 annual reproductions, or roughly 1,500 wolves.

 p From a legal point of view, the matter is clear. Consistent with State sovereignty, each Party has sole responsibility for developing and implementing the measures for species and habitats on national territory that it has accepted under the Convention, including decision-making on possible derogations. These national responsibilities are underpinned by general obligations for international cooperation under the Convention and customary international law. They cannot be delegated because a species or habitat is thriving beyond national boundaries (where the Party concerned has no legal or management powers). For wolves, this means that even if the portion of a population found across an international boundary is secure, this does not justify a derogation if the population on national territory is not viable or where other satisfactory solutions can be found. This approach is supported by all Convention policy documents addressing wolves, which combine recommendations for sub-regional cooperation with individual country-specific actions adapted to national circumstances. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0051" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 51  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 51 Clare Shine,  span class="smallcaps smallerCapital" Legal Report on the Possible Need to Amend Appendix II of the Convention for the Wolf  span  (2005), Bern Convention Doc.

The aforementioned reference by the Standing Committee to “a viable population of wolf shared between” Norway and Sweden evidently does not give Norway license to adjust its national wolf population to a fraction of what it would otherwise have needed to be in order to comply with Article 2. The bottom line in this regard is the nature of the international legal system, consisting of independent, sovereign states, which can ultimately be held accountable only for their own legal commitments—as indicated also in the long quotation above. That system exercises a defining influence on any interpretation of an international treaty such as the Bern Convention. Indeed, because of the obvious need to keep states from hiding behind the performance of others, the notion of shared rather than individual state responsibility for achieving conservation objectives is still in its infancy. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0054" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 54  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 54  i See also  i  Arie Trouwborst,  i The Practice of Shared Responsibility in Relation to Nature Conservation, in  i   span class="smallcaps smallerCapital" The Practice of Shared Responsibility 987  span  (André Nollkaemper &amp; Ilias Plakokefalos eds. 2017).  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span  The approach advocated in the Carnivore Guidelines provides an interesting potential exception in this regard, but the legal viability of this approach—and in particular its ability to influence the interpretation of Article 2 (and, indeed, Article 9)—utterly hinges on the existence of formal safeguards agreed at the intergovernmental level to ensure the observance of the population-level plan concerned and the achievement of its objectives. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0055" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 55  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 55  i See also  i  Trouwborst,  i supra  i  note 44.  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span  Moreover, even with such safeguards in place, it cannot be taken for granted that the existence of a population-level plan would as such lower the standards imposed on Convention parties by Article 2.

Norwegian wolves have featured on the agendas of the Standing Committee and the Secretariat of the Convention more than once during the three decades that Norway has been a contracting party. This primarily has been the result of Norwegian NGOs filing complaints alleging breaches of the Convention by Norway, as part of the so-called case-file procedure. According to this procedure, which has been developed to promote compliance with the Convention, the Standing Committee may examine potential violations, including through an on-the-spot appraisal when necessary, and as appropriate recommend a particular course of action to the contracting party involved to resolve the situation. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0059" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 59  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 59  i See generally  i  Bowman et al.,  i supra  i  note 7;  i see also  i  Fleurke &amp; Trouwborst,  i supra  i  note 7.  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span  Norway has so far not been expressly reprimanded for any alleged violation of the Convention regarding wolves. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0060" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 60  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 60 Register of Bern Convention Complaints, December 5–8, 2017, Doc.

First, the Standing Committee has an ample margin of discretion in deciding which files to open, and decisions in this regard may be politically motivated. (A rough but incomplete parallel can be drawn with public prosecutors' discretion under domestic legal systems in selecting which criminal cases to pursue and which to drop.) In general, many more complaints are filed than case-files opened. Second, the Standing Committee has generally tended to operate on the basis of dialogue and diplomacy rather than confrontation. Indeed, its decisions concerning most opened case-files have been recommendatory rather than reproachful, and only exceptionally has it issued clear statements that a breach of obligation has occurred. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0061" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 61  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 61  i See, e.g.  i , Bowman et al.,  i supra  i  note 7, at 340–341.  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span  Moreover, as Epstein observes, the Committee “has been hesitant to even open case files, as doing so brings an adversarial flavor to the conversation.” span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0062" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 62  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 62 Epstein,  i supra  i  note 2, at 561.  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span  Third, the Standing Committee is indeed a political body, not a judicial one. Legally binding statements concerning violations of the Convention can be issued only by domestic courts, by arbitral tribunals established under Article 18 of the Convention (although the latter route of judicial dispute settlement has hitherto been avoided by the parties), and, in theory, by other international courts and arbitral tribunals.  p 
 p xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:oasis="http:  docs.oasis-open.org ns oasis-exchange table" This is certainly not to say that because the Resolutions, Recommendations, Guidelines, and Declarations of the Standing Committee are not legally binding, they are therefore devoid of legal significance. As noted previously, depending on their phrasing and other circumstances, the Committee's acts can have interpretive value as a “subsequent agreement” or “subsequent practice.” span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0063" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 63  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 63 VCLT,  i supra  i  note 19, at art. 31(3). Examples of decisions with apparent interpretive significance are: Bern Convention Revised Resolution No. 2 (1993), adopted 2011 and partly bracketed in 2014, addressing the scope of Articles 8 and 9; Bern Convention Recommendation No. 142 (2009), addressing the definition of “invasive alien species” in a climate change context; and Bern Convention Recommendation No. 173 (2014) on hybridization between wolves and dogs. The interpretive significance of the latter recommendation, for instance, is apparent from the following statement in its Preamble: “Wishing to clarify the meaning of the provisions of the Convention in respect of the problem of wolf-dog hybridisation.”  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span  It is worth mentioning within this context that the Standing Committee has never actually expressly declared, when considering Norway's wolf policy, that the latter was fully in line with the Convention. In any event, the main point for present purposes is that, in legal terms, a decision of the Standing Committee to refrain from opening a case-file does, in and of itself, not signify that no violation of the Convention has taken place. span class="ref-lnk fn-ref-lnk"  a data-rid="fn0064" href="#" data-reflink="fn"  sup 64  sup   a  span class="ref-overlay scrollable-ref"  span class="ref-close"   span  span class="ref-fn-p" 64  i See also  i  Epstein,  i supra  i  note 2, at 584 (discussing Norwegian wolves): “Failure to open a file on the part of the Standing Committee does not, of course, mean that the contested action is compliant with the Bern Convention.”  span  a onclick="doAnimate('inline_frontnotes', 'slow');" class="frontnotes" View all notes  a   span   span   p

Furnishing parties with advice regarding their implementation of the Bern Convention has been one of the Secretariat's regular activities, and with its impartial approach and wealth of expertise and experience, it has generally been well placed to do so. That said, for present purposes it suffices to clarify that in legal terms, statements by the Secretariat do not by themselves put any weight in the scales of the interpretational scheme reflected in the VCLT. Hence, there is no need here to examine the Secretariat's record regarding Norway's wolf policy in any detail.  p 
 p xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:oasis="http:  docs.oasis-open.org ns oasis-exchange table" The legal analysis above, applying nothing but public international law's basic rules of treaty interpretation, strongly suggests that certain basic tenets of Norway's past and current wolf policy are at odds with the country's obligations under the Bern Convention. In particular, the current wolf population target of four to six reproductions appears to be well below the level required by Article 2.  p 
 p xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:oasis="http:  docs.oasis-open.org ns oasis-exchange table" Some of the interpretive issues dealt with above are not yet fully settled. This particularly concerns the role of national versus transboundary population goals  i vis-à-vis  i  some of the provisions of the Bern Convention (although this uncertainty leaves unaffected the conclusion above regarding the incompatibility of Norway's wolf policy with the Convention). Other issues are much less ambiguous. Some of the confusion concerning the requirements imposed by Article 2 of the Convention is clearly unnecessary, and the same is true regarding the legal significance of the past involvement of the Convention's Standing Committee and Secretariat with Norway's wolf policy.  p 
 p xmlns:mml="http:  www.w3.org 1998 Math MathML" xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:oasis="http:  docs.oasis-open.org ns oasis-exchange table" Whereas it was not difficult to establish that the current official wolf targets fail to meet Norway's obligations under the Bern Convention, it is much harder to pinpoint how many Norwegian wolf packs  i would  i  satisfy the minimum requirements of Article 2. What is clear, however, is that the more wolves that Norway allows, and the more robust the Scandinavian population as a whole becomes, and the better the coordination of wolf management between Sweden and Norway becomes, the easier it will be to satisfy the conditions of Article 9 when Norwegian society deems the killing of wolves desirable.  p

 p 29 Article 9 enables derogations only from Articles 4–8.  i See  i  Bowman et al.,  i supra  i  note 7, at 320. Incidentally, it would also seem that parties' obligations under Article 2 cannot be affected by reservations as allowed under Article 22(1). This is a consequence, in particular, of the delimitation made in the latter provision to reservations regarding “species specified in Appendices I to III and or, for certain species mentioned in the reservation …, regarding certain means or methods of killing, capture and other exploitation listed in Appendix IV.” Bern Convention,  i supra  i  note 7, at art. 22(1). Reservations thus presumably affect only the obligations specifically coupled with particular Appendices. As the scope of Article 2 encompasses all native wild flora and fauna species, it would be incongruous to assume that Article 22 would allow for reservations excluding Appendix I–III species from the scope of Article 2 while not allowing for reservations excluding common, unlisted species from the scope of Article 2. Also note that Article 22(1) prohibits “reservations of a general nature.” Id. According to the Explanatory Report to the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, 19 September 1979, C.E.T.S. 104,  span class="smallcaps smallerCapital" ¶  span  67, the latter “prohibition of reservations of a general nature would automatically exclude the possibility for a Contracting Party to reduce its commitments to a level where the Convention would not affect it anymore.”  p

The Standing Committee to the Bern Convention has always followed the principle of ‘obligation of results' to implement the convention. This implies that Parties are free to choose the mechanisms, procedures and instruments necessary in order to comply with the obligations of the convention, but that they are requested to show that the ‘results’ of their actions satisfy the requirements of the convention: the fact that some populations listed in Appendix II of the convention have proven unsatisfactory conservation status can be sufficient to lead the Standing Committee, in accordance with the objectives of the convention, to urge Parties to take the necessary measures”).  p

 p 58 Report of the 21st Meeting of the Standing Committee, Bern Convention Doc. T-PVS(2001)89E (December 7, 2001), at 5.4; see also the lengthy discussion in Norway's 2016 White Paper,  i supra  i  note 16, about the two countries' relative shares of the wolf population, with the White Paper concluding that the present division can be justified by the differences in sheep conflict between the countries. Notably, however, there are relatively few sheep within the designated wolf zone; alternative solutions for sheep farming conflicts exist, and with regard to all other wolf-related conflicts—domestic reindeer, fear, conflicts with moose hunting, etc.—the situation is roughly the same in Norway and Sweden.  p

 p 63 VCLT,  i supra  i  note 19, at art. 31(3). Examples of decisions with apparent interpretive significance are: Bern Convention Revised Resolution No. 2 (1993), adopted 2011 and partly bracketed in 2014, addressing the scope of Articles 8 and 9; Bern Convention Recommendation No. 142 (2009), addressing the definition of “invasive alien species” in a climate change context; and Bern Convention Recommendation No. 173 (2014) on hybridization between wolves and dogs. The interpretive significance of the latter recommendation, for instance, is apparent from the following statement in its Preamble: “Wishing to clarify the meaning of the provisions of the Convention in respect of the problem of wolf-dog hybridisation.”  p 
 p 64  i See also  i  Epstein,  i supra  i  note 2, at 584 (discussing Norwegian wolves): “Failure to open a file on the part of the Standing Committee does not, of course, mean that the contested action is compliant with the Bern Convention.”  p
