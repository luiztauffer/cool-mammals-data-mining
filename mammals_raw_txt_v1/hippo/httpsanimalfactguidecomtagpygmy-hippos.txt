 p  a href="http:  www.lowryparkzoo.com " target="_blank" Lowry Park Zoo  a  in Tampa, Florida welcomed a baby pygmy hippo on November 15. The female pygmy hippo calf weighs about 10 pounds. As an adult, she will grow to be about 350-550 pounds and stand about three feet tall at the shoulder. Pygmy hippos are much smaller than their relative, the Nile hippo.  p 
 p The little calf has not yet been named, but the zoo is launching a naming contest on its  a href="http:  www.lowryparkzoo.com wildwonderland hippo_xmas_contest.php" target="_blank" Wild Wonderland website  a . The zoo’s animal care team has selected several African names starting with the letter Z in honor of mother hippo “Zsa Zsa.” The name that receives the highest number of votes through Monday, December 3, will be declared the winner.  p 
 p The birth is the second in the zoo’s history and a great step in preserving the population of these rare hippos. “The birth of this rare and endangered nocturnal forest species marks only the 55th individual in the managed population within North American and underlines the importance of our br 
conservation efforts with this species,” said Dr. Larry Killmar, vice president of animal science and conservation. “With fewer than 3,000 pigmy hippos in the wild, each birth is vital if we have any hope of saving this truly unique species.”  p 
 p In the wild, the pygmy can be found in West Africa in lowland forests. The species is mainly confined to Liberia, with small numbers in neighboring countries. The animals are comfortable both on land and in water, but rest and forage near waterways. They can most often be seen in shady sites near swamps, riverbanks or muddy areas.  p

 p Monifa, a baby pygmy hippopotamus, was born 3 weeks ago at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo. Pygmy hippos are extremely rare in the wild, with only around 3000 living in Africa.  p 
 p The birth, which was the first in 23 years for the zoo, was a difficult one. Monifa was born backwards, which may have been problematic in the wild, and she was also very weak.  However, zookeepers stepped in, and Monifa is now healthy.  p
