 p The world's deadliest animal isn't a shark or even a human. Drawing from a  a href="https:  www.gatesnotes.com Health Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week" graphic from Bill Gates' blog  a , we decided to rank the world's deadliest animals.  p 
 p Most of the deaths caused by animals, it turns out, have less to do with the animals themselves than the diseases they unwittingly transmit.  p 
 p Note that some numbers are harder to get an accurate read on than others, so these are for the most part rough estimates - sometimes very rough. And the list is representative of different kinds of deadly animals, but it's by no means comprehensive.  p 
 p Here are some of the animals responsible for the most human deaths. The scariest predators aren't as dangerous as you might expect - but don't underestimate the little guys.  p
