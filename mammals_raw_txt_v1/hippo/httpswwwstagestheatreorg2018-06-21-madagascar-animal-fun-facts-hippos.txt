 p DreamWorks MADAGASCAR – A Musical Adventure follows the journey of a lion, zebra, a giraffe and a hippo! To get ready: Here are FIVE (plus a few more) fun facts about HIPPOS ~  p 
 p * Hippos are considered the second largest land animal on Earth (first place goes to the elephant!)  p 
 p * To stay cool in the blistering African heat, hippos spend most of their day in rivers and lakes.  p 
 p * Their eyes, nose and ears are located on the top of their head, which means they can see and breathe whilst submerged in the water. What’s more, these super-cool creatures sweat an oily red liquid which helps protect their skin from drying out – and acts as a sunblock, too! Cool, huh?  p 
 p * They are large semi-aquatic mammals.  p 
 p * Today, they are largely confined to protected areas in East African countries.  p 
 p * Hippos are most active at night, when they forage for food. They are herbivores, and eat mostly grass – and boy do they eat grass! In just one night, they can guzzle down up to 35kg of their favorite grub!  p 
 p * Despite their enormous size, hippos are great swimmers and can hold their breath for up to five minutes underwater.  p 
 p * When completely submerged, their ears and nostrils fold shut to keep water out.  p 
 p * Female hippos, called cows, give birth every two years, usually to a single calf. Soon after birth, the mother and her baby join up with other cows and calves for protection against predators, such as crocodiles, lions and hyenas.  p 
 p * In the wild hippos live for around 40 years. In captivity, they tend to live longer and may reach up to 50 years old.  p
