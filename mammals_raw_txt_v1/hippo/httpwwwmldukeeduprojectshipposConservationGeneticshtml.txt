2001, researchers will begin collecting DNA from hippos around
Tanzania. The information gained from this program will serve to
examine the inter-relatedness of hippos within and between wild
populations. This knowledge will provide much-needed insights into
several areas critical to proper management of hippos and their
long-term conservation.  b   font   p

 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text1" During
the course of this program, DNA will be collected from from hippos in
the wild as well as in zoos for the purposes of performing conservation
activities and genetic research. Genetic markers will be assessed from
hippos in the wild to identify groups of hippos experiencing increased
levels of heterozygosity and or genetic isolation. This information
will provide researchers and wildlife managers with information on the
groups of hippos that are most at risk. Future applications of this
data will include identifying the existence of regional subspecies, and
the genetic health of the small remaining population of pygmy hippos.
The initial phases of this program are anticipated to last at least 3
years.  span style='font-family: "Bookman Old Style";'   span

 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2" This
is a long-term project, anticipated to continue for 4 years. The goal
of the project is to use conservation genetics technology to inform and
educate the conservation community on the status of both hippo species
and to determine potential management actions that would foster species
survival.   p

of this project are to:   p 
 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2" a)
Use hippo tissue or blood samples from captive populations to identify
genetic markers that will allow for comparisons within and between wild
hippo populations. Using tissue and blood, we hope to develop markers
that are robust and can be used with on fecal matter.  p 
 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2"  b)
Use genetic markers to explore possible sub-species between East,
Southern and West African common hippo populations. These data will
also provide estimates of population isolation and heterozygosity by
comparing genetic similarities between populations within a country or
region.  p 
 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2"  c)
Use genetic markers to evaluate heterozygosity and to estimate the
number of individual pygmy hippos within their remaining range.  br 



        p

Work collaboratively with veterinarians and park managers in African
countries to provide exposure and experience with genetic sampling
techniques and equipment. Through this collaborative effort, we call
attention to the vulnerable status of hippos for land-managing agencies
and the international conservation community.  br

Generate recommendations and conservation strategies that will foster
hippo conservation and have a direct impact on protection of remaining
hippo populations in their native countries.   p

and Methods:   font   p 
 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2" The
program will meet its objectives using advanced technology to both
retrieve DNA samples as well as to perform the necessary tests.  p 
 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2" At
the beginning of the program, tissue samples will be collected from
populations of hippos in zoos in the U.S. and Europe. The relatedness
of these hippos is generally well-known. These tissue samples will be
sent to a genetics lab in Tokyo to verify the best genetic markers for
identifying the relatedness of hippos. In time, the genetic samples may
be taken from fecal matter rather than directly from hippo's bodies.  p 
 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2" Researchers
will then move to the field and begin collecting tissues samples from
hippos with a one-of-a-kind, remotely retrievable, skin biopsy dart.
The dart is projected using a crossbow. Upon hitting the animal, a tiny
piece of skin is taken. The dart, which is connected to high-strength
fishing line, is then reeled back in to the researchers on the shore.
The tissue samples will then be sent to Tokyo where the relevant
genetic markers identified in the zoo studies will be assessed for the
wild hippos.  p

 p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Bookman Old Style;" editable="true" id="Text2" Data
collected from this program will be made public in research journals as
well as on the IUCN Hippo SubGroup's website and newsletter. 
Further, details of the data and resulting insights into conservations
strategies will be returned to officials in Africa working toward more
effective hippo management practices.  At the end of the
project,
the darting equipment and related biopsy dart accessories will be
donated to the Tanzanian National Parks veterinary program.  br
