 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="120" data-total-count="2490" “Colombia is absolute paradise for hippos, with its climate, vegetation and no natural predators,” Mr. Morkel said.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="252" data-total-count="2742" “But as much as I love hippos, they are an alien species and extremely dangerous to people who disrupt them,” he continued. “Since castration of the males is very difficult, the only realistic option is to shoot those found off the hacienda.”  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="2965" The uproar has its roots in 1981, when Mr. Escobar was busy assembling a luxurious retreat here called Hacienda Nápoles that included a Mediterranean-style mansion, swimming pools, a 1,000-seat bull ring and an airstrip.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="3166" “He needed a tranquil place to unwind with his family,” said Fernando Montoya, 57, a sculptor from Medellín who built giant statues here of Tyrannosaurus rex and other dinosaurs for Mr. Escobar.  p

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="3735" But Mr. Escobar was not content with just fake dinosaurs and bullfights.

 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="196" data-total-count="3931" Some of the animals died or were transferred to zoos around the time Mr. Escobar was killed. But the hippos largely stayed put, flourishing in the artificial lakes dug at Mr. Escobar’s behest.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="310" data-total-count="4241" Carlos Palacio, 54, head of animal husbandry at Nápoles, said Mr. Escobar started in 1981 with four hippos. Now, he said, at least 28 live on the estate. “With our current level of six births a year set to climb, we could easily have more than 100 hippos on this hacienda in a decade,” Mr. Palacio said.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="4447" “Some experts see this herd as a treasure of the natural world in case Africa’s hippo population suffers a sharp decline,” Mr. Palacio continued. “Others view our growth as a kind of time bomb.”  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="4713" The number of hippos on the hacienda could have reached 31 had Pepe, the slain hippo, not clashed about three years ago with the herd’s dominant hippo, then left with a mate for other pastures. Once established near Puerto Berrío, the mate gave birth to a calf.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="4942" Faced with the possibility of a nascent colony away from Nápoles, Colombian authorities decided to act. After all, hippos, despite their docile appearance, are thought to kill more people in Africa than any other large animal.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="5099" Unable to find a zoo that would accept the three hippos in Puerto Berrío, officials in the department, or province, of Antioquia considered their options.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="394" data-total-count="5493" Capturing them was expensive, costing as much as $40,000 for each hippo, in a country where malnourishment among the poor remains a major problem, said Luis Alfonso Escobar — not related to Pablo Escobar — head of Corantioquia, a state environmental organization. Taking them to Africa was dangerous, in addition to being expensive, because of the new diseases they might introduce there.  p 
 p Advertisement  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="144" data-total-count="5637" id="story-continues-5" So the officials opted for a hunt and hired a nonprofit conservation group, the Neotropical Wildlife Foundation, to help manage the operation.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="5913" The foundation brought in two experienced hunters, Federico Pfeil-Schneider and Christian Pfeil-Schneider, both of whom also represent the car manufacturer Porsche in Colombia. To ensure the hunting party’s safety, the environmentalists also secured an escort of soldiers.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="364" data-total-count="6277" All went as planned until the hunt’s  a href="http:  www.caracoltv.com articulo145200-gobierno-autorizo-matar-a-hipopotamos-escaparon-de-la-hacienda-napoles" title="Video report" details  a  and the photo of the soldiers appeared in the news media. Outrage ensued. Newspapers speculated on the fate of Pepe’s severed head. (Luis Alfonso Escobar, of Corantioquia, rejected rumors that it went to the hunters.) A judge in Medellín issued a ruling suspending the hunt for Pepe’s mate and their offspring.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="6536" Meanwhile, other hippos may be on the loose. Mr. Palacio, the hippo caretaker here, said at least one was lurking in the waters of a neighboring ranch. Mr. Morkel, the veterinarian, said one or two others could have wandered off, according to local reports.  p 
 p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="164" data-total-count="6700" On the grounds of Hacienda Nápoles, a sign warns visitors to the theme park. “Stay in your vehicle after 6 p.m.,” it reads. “Hippopotamuses on the road.”  p
