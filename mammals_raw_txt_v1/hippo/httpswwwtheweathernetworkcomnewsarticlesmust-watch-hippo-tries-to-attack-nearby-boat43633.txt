 p The name hippopotamus is Greek for “river horse” and it’s an apt name as the large animal can run in spurts faster than the average human.  p 
 p Their unpredictability makes them one of the most dangerous mammals in Africa. Their large teeth can easily perforate human skin and bones. They are responsible for more human fatalities than most other large animals in Africa.  p 
 p Easily frightened and extremely territorial, hippos have been known to not hesistate to attack—especially if their young babies are nearby.  p 
 p In November, a hippopotamus overturned a boat killing 12 children and one adult. In Malawi, a hippo attacked and killed one adult on Christmas Eve.  p
