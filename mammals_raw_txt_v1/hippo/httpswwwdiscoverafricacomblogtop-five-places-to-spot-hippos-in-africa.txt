All nine species of Baobab have been used for centuries in traditional…  p

                    We spent 10 days in South Africa going around many places in December 2016. Every aspect was arranged perfectly and went really smooth. 

Our flight to Cape Town was very delayed and our pickup vehicle couldn't find us but the attention provided to us through customer service was really quick and professional and we got our pickup arranged in no time. Our special thanks to the Megan and Matthys for taking special care in suggesting the best ones considering our two young boys and our group of eight. 

Even though we have travelled across the world quite a lot we wanted to go with private guided tour this time and i should say we got the best guides from Hilton Ross arranged by Discover Africa team during our Cape Town stay. The whole trip was very memorable just because of the people part of Discover Africa Group.
