 p There are two living species of hippopotamus in two genera; the pygmy hippo,  i  a href=" wiki Choeropsis_liberiensis" class="mw-redirect" title="Choeropsis liberiensis" Choeropsis liberiensis  a   i  of the forests of west Africa, and the common hippo,  i  a href=" wiki Hippopotamus_amphibius" class="mw-redirect" title="Hippopotamus amphibius" Hippopotamus amphibius  a   i .

 p Hippopotamuses are large mammals, with short, stumpy legs, and barrel-shaped bodies. They have large heads, with broad mouths, and nostrils placed at the top of their snouts. Like pigs, they have four toes, but unlike pigs, all of the toes are used in walking. Hippopotamids are  a href=" wiki Unguligrade" class="mw-redirect" title="Unguligrade" unguligrade  a , although, unlike most other such animals, they have no hooves, instead using a pad of tough connective tissue on each foot. Their stomachs have three chambers, but they are not true  a href=" wiki Ruminant" title="Ruminant" ruminants  a .
  p 
 p The living species are smooth-skinned and lack both  a href=" wiki Sebaceous_gland" title="Sebaceous gland" sebaceous glands  a  and  a href=" wiki Sweat_gland" title="Sweat gland" sweat glands  a . The outer  a href=" wiki Epidermis_(skin)" class="mw-redirect" title="Epidermis (skin)" epidermis  a  is relatively thin, so hippos dehydrate rapidly in dry environments. sup id="cite_ref-EoM_1-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-EoM-1" [1]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Both the  a href=" wiki Incisor" title="Incisor" incisors  a  and  a href=" wiki Canine_(tooth)" class="mw-redirect" title="Canine (tooth)" canines  a  are large and tusk-like, although the canine tusks are by far the larger. The tusks grow throughout life. The postcanine teeth are large and complex, suited for chewing the plant matter that comprises their diets. The number of incisors varies even within the same species, but the general  a href=" wiki Dentition" title="Dentition" dental formula  a  is given in the table below: 
  p 
 p The hippopotamids are descended from the  a href=" wiki Anthracothere" class="mw-redirect" title="Anthracothere" anthracotheres  a , a family of semiaquatic and terrestrial artiodactyls that appeared in the late  a href=" wiki Eocene" title="Eocene" Eocene  a , and are thought to have resembled small- or narrow-headed hippos.  The hippos split off from the anthracotheres some time during the  a href=" wiki Miocene" title="Miocene" Miocene  a .  After the appearance of the hippopotamids, the remaining anthracotheres went into a decline brought about by a combination of climatic change and competition with their descendants, until the last genus,  i  a href=" wiki Merycopotamus" title="Merycopotamus" Merycopotamus  a   i , died out in the early  a href=" wiki Pliocene" title="Pliocene" Pliocene  a  of India.
  p 
 p There were once many species of hippopotamid, but only two survive today:  i Hippopotamus amphibius  i , and  i Choeropsis liberiensis  i . They are the last survivors of two major  a href=" wiki Evolution" title="Evolution" evolutionary  a  lineages, the hippos proper and the pygmy hippos, respectively; these lineages could arguably be considered  a href=" wiki Subfamilies" class="mw-redirect" title="Subfamilies" subfamilies  a , but their relationship to each other - apart from being fairly distant relatives - is not well resolved.

 p The enigmatic  a href=" wiki Miocene" title="Miocene" Miocene  a   i  a href=" wiki Kenyapotamus" title="Kenyapotamus" Kenyapotamus  a   i  is insufficiently known to be assigned a place in the hippo  a href=" wiki Phylogeny" class="mw-redirect" title="Phylogeny" phylogeny  a  with any degree of certainty. In addition, the genus  i  a href=" wiki Hexaprotodon" title="Hexaprotodon" Hexaprotodon  a   i , in a sense now restricted to an extinct group of animals once living around the northern and northeastern  a href=" wiki Indian_Ocean" title="Indian Ocean" Indian Ocean  a , which formerly included most ancient hippos, has turned out to be  a href=" wiki Paraphyletic" class="mw-redirect" title="Paraphyletic" paraphyletic  a .

 p The lower canine teeth of hippopotamids are similar in function and structure to the tusks of  a href=" wiki Elephant" title="Elephant" elephants  a . While hippopotamids and elephants are only very distantly related within the Mammalia, the lower canine teeth of both groups are long and have a slight curve, and species of both families use this structure when fighting.
