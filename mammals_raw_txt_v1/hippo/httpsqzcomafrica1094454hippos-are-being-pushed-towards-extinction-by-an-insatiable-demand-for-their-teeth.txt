 p class="a1dbe africa" When it comes to the global wildlife trade, conservationists have a long list of things to be worried about. They might need to add hippos to the top of that list.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" A  a href="http:  onlinelibrary.wiley.com wol1 doi 10.1111 aje.12441 abstract" recent study  a  published in the African Journal of Ecology by researchers from the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Hong Kong reveals significant discrepancies in the trade volumes of hippo teeth could be threatening their survival.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" Hippos are classified as vulnerable by the  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 10103 0" International Union for the Conservation of Nature  a  (IUCN). Unregulated hunting for their meat, skin, and teeth, combined with shrinking habitats and increased hippo-human conflict have lead to a decline in populations across Africa. At the current rates, the species could disappear within a century.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" The demand for hippo teeth sharply escalated after a 1989 ban on the international trade of elephant ivory, according to IUCN. The carved ivory ornaments and accessories made from them now command  a href="http:  news.nationalgeographic.com 2016 12 wildlife-watch-hippo-teeth-trafficking-uganda " a lower price on the global market  a  than those made of elephant tusks, likely because it remains legal to import the teeth into many countries. Hippo teeth are also easier to smuggle than elephant tusks.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" The researchers examined records dating back from 1975 from CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. They found that almost all the global trade in hippo teeth goes through Hong Kong— a href="https:  www.reuters.com article us-hongkong-ivory hong-kong-seizes-largest-ivory-haul-in-30-years-idUSKBN19R0W3" a top transit hub for endangered species  a —with 75% of those imports originating from just two countries: Uganda and Tanzania.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" But the volume of imports declared by Hong Kong was substantially different than the exports reported by those two countries,  a href="http:  onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 aje.12441 abstract;jsessionid=3C227BEF7D111CC492FED64CECE828E2.f04t04" the study found  a , suggesting that the trade exceeded internationally agreed upon quotas. The authors found 14,000kg (approximately 30,860lb) of hippo teeth unaccounted for—equivalent to 2,700 hippos, or 2% of the world’s hippo population.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" “This gross discordance in trade data undermines regulatory measures and challenges the persistence of hippo populations in Africa,” authors Alexandra Andersson and Luke Gibson  a href="http:  onlinelibrary.wiley.com doi 10.1111 aje.12441 abstract;jsessionid=3C227BEF7D111CC492FED64CECE828E2.f04t04" write  a .  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" Uganda  a href="http:  news.nationalgeographic.com 2016 12 wildlife-watch-hippo-teeth-trafficking-uganda " banned trade in hippo teeth  a  in 2014.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" The discrepancies in hippo teeth trade volumes, and of other endangered species, could lead to the “unmanageable exploitation levels” of those animals and ultimately, speed up their extinction, the study’s authors argue.  p 
 p class="a1dbe africa" “As a hub of legal commerce in rare animals and parts, authorities in Hong Kong must have a precise knowledge and control of endangered species being imported, sold or exported in its territory,” Andersson  a href="http:  www.hku.hk press news_detail_16672.html" said in a statement  a . ”The fate of hippos—and a plethora of other species—could depend on it.”  p
