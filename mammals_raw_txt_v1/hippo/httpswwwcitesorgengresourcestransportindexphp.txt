 p class="m_green"  strong Introduction  strong   p 
 p At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) (Bern, 1976), it was resolved that guidelines on the care and shipment of live specimens of species listed under the Convention should be prepared. At the special working session of the Conference (Geneva, 1977), it was agreed that such guidelines should apply to all animals and plants, not just those currently listed under the Convention. It was further agreed that such guidelines should cover all forms of transport, be practical, and should be directed to the use of persons actually handling the consignments as well as the enforcement authorities.  p 
 p The resulting Guidelines for the transport and preparation for shipment of live wild animals and plants were broadly based upon the “Live Animals Regulations” (LAR) of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and were finalized and made available to Parties in 1981.  p 
 p At the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Santiago, 2002), Parties determined that the Guidelines were out of date and directed the Animals Committee to consider their replacement. The Animals Committee’s Transport Working Group (TWG) subsequently determined that the IATA LAR provided appropriate guidance in most situations for the transport of live wild specimens of all CITES-listed species, regardless of the mode of transport.  p 
 p At the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Bangkok, 2004), the Parties adopted a Decision directing the Animals Committee, in consultation with the Plants Committee and the Secretariat, to develop up-to-date guidance on the transport of live animals and plants of CITES-listed species to replace the 1981 CITES Guidelines. The subsequent work of the TWG led to a revision of Resolution Conf. 10.21 (Rev. CoP14) at the 14th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (The Hague, 2007). The revised Resolution recommended that Parties promote the use of the IATA LAR and IATA Perishable Cargo Regulations (PCR- for the transport of Plants) by Management Authorities, and that these IATA Regulations be used as a reference to indicate suitable conditions for transport by means other than air where appropriate. The Resolution also recommended that the LAR and PCR be incorporated into Parties' domestic legislation or policies.  p 
 p At the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Doha, 2010), the Animals Committee was directed to develop a supplement to the IATA LAR for CITES-listed taxa that required non-air transport conditions different from those listed in the IATA LAR. The Conference also agreed to delete the reference to the use of the Guidelines for the transport and preparation for shipment of live wild animals and plants in box 5 of the CITES permit, leaving references only to the use of the IATA LAR and PCR.  p 
 p The envisaged supplement to the IATA LAR is presented here. It is a two part document. The first part covers "General Conditions" for the transport of live animals. The second part deals with the "Technical Specifications" that deviate from the IATA LAR in respect to the non-air-transport of certain taxa and only apply to the species listed therein.  p 
 p Like the IATA LAR, non-air transport methods are continually evolving and this supplement may be amended over time as innovations in live wild animal transport are made. CITES will collaborate with the IATA Live Animals and Perishables Board to determine whether and how this supplement may be included in future IATA editions of the LAR and then made available to Parties.  p 
 p This supplement was developed to indicate where the IATA LAR is not entirely sufficient for the non-air transport for certain CITES-listed species. The deviations provided in the supplement only apply to the non-air transport of the identified taxa. All wildlife, including the identified taxa herein, may be transported by air, road, rail or ship according to the methods listed in the most current edition of the IATA LAR. a id="1" name="1"    a   p

 p  strong 2.1. General conditions for the transport of live animals  strong   p 
 p The transport of an animal constitutes an unnatural situation for the animal and is most likely to cause it some degree of stress. High levels of stress may increase metabolic rates, hazardous behaviour, chances of injuries and susceptibility to diseases.  p 
 p For reasons of animal welfare, animal transport should be quick, efficient and strive to avoid as much stress as possible to the animal.  p 
 p The transport of live animals must be well planned, well prepared and effectively executed!  p 
 p For long distances, air transport should be the first consideration!  p 
 p Animals must:  p 
 p An animal that is injured or that has physiological weaknesses or pathological problems should not be considered fit for transport especially if:  p 
 p However, sick and or injured animals may be transported if:  p 
 p Sedatives should not be used on animals to be transported unless strictly necessary to ensure the welfare of the animals and should only be used under veterinary supervision.  p 
 p In cases where anaesthesia has been given, the animal must be completely awake, alert and able to balance itself before the transport commences. Detailed information must be clearly noted on the container and accompanying paperwork. a id="2_2" name="2_2"    a   p 
 p style="text-align: right"  a href="#top"   img border="0" height="9" src=" sites default files eng graphics top.gif" width="28"    a   p 
 p  strong 2.2. Planning obligations for the transport of live animals  strong   p 
 p Transporters and organizers of transports have an obligation to plan the transport to ensure that the welfare of the animals is not compromised.  p 
 p Sound knowledge of the species in transport is of greatest importance. Comprehensive information, when available, about the animal should contain:  p 
 p Weather conditions, status of transport routes, potential causes for delays, border wait times, legal obligations that may include commercial licenses, driver‘s rest, traffic bans, truck scales, chase vehicles, passport requirements, visas, locations of fuel and repair services, etc. should be investigated and must be taken into account prior to the onset of transport.  p 
 p National and international laws and regulations as applicable in the countries of origin, transit, and destination must be investigated and complied with. Before preparing a live animal for transport, shippers must always obtain full information well in advance concerning import export, in-transit permit, veterinary health certificate, veterinary import export permit, CITES import export re-export permit, veterinary examination, pre-arrival declaration, and clearance times, quarantine, ports of entry, border inspection posts and prohibition restrictions, which may include traffic bans, veterinary restrictions as well as restrictions for food and bedding provided for the animal.  p 
 p Customs and veterinary clearances, as well as other relevant services may not be available on weekends and holidays.  p 
 p It is the shipper's responsibility to ascertain what national legislation regarding the protection of animals during transport is in force for all countries through which the animals are being transported, and to obtain all necessary documents, permits, certificates and licenses prior to departure.  p 
 p All necessary advance arrangements in compliance with applicable laws and regulations must be made to minimize the duration of the transport and to meet the animals' needs during and after transport. Arrangements must be made for animals to be delivered to the consignee upon arrival at its destination. The shipper is obliged to inform the consignee of the anticipated time of arrival and the receiver should make every effort to be present at the time the animal arrives at its destination.  p 
 p The shipper is responsible for all necessary marking and labelling regarding the transport and or containers.  p 
 p Contingency plans in the event of an emergency are strongly recommended.  p 
 p Contingency plans should contain information on:  p 
 p style="text-align: right"  a href="#top"   img border="0" height="9" src=" sites default files eng graphics top.gif" width="28"    a   p 
 p  strong 2.3. Means of transport  strong   p 
 p The means of transport, containers and their fittings should be designed, constructed, maintained and operated so as to:  p 
 p Special consideration must be given to measures to prevent adverse impacts from climatic changes in the case of transports over long distances or over major differences in elevation.  p 
 p Partitions and compartments must be strong enough to withstand the weight of the animal.  p 
 p Access to each individual compartment, without disturbing other animals, should be provided in case an animal is in distress or injured.  p 
 p Animals should be provided with appropriate bedding or equivalent material which guarantees their comfort appropriate to the species, the number of animals being transported, the transportation time, and the weather. The material should adequately absorb urine and faeces and must not contravene legislation as applicable.  p 
 p A sufficient supply of bedding material should be carried on the vehicle or should be available en route as required.  p 
 p The means of transport should be equipped with a roof of light colour that is able to prevent animals from escaping.  p 
 p Containers must always be kept upright and severe jolts or shaking should be minimized.  p 
 p Containers must be secured throughout the transport so as to prevent displacement due to the movements and or vibrations of the conveyance.  p 
 p Vehicles should be equipped with appropriate-sized fire-extinguishers.  p 
 p Shippers should crate-train or otherwise acclimate animals to be transported with transport container and vehicle.  p 
 p Surveillance systems to monitor animals during transport are highly recommended. a id="2_4" name="2_4"    a   p 
 p style="text-align: right"  a href="#top"   img border="0" height="9" src=" sites default files eng graphics top.gif" width="28"    a   p 
 p  strong 2.4. Marking and labelling  strong   p 
 p Vehicles in which animals are transported should be clearly marked indicating the presence of live animals except when the animals are transported in containers that are clearly marked indicating the presence of live animals and with a sign indicating the top of the container.  p 
 p All markings and labels must be legible, durable and printed or otherwise marked on or affixed to the external surface of the container or vehicle.  p 
 p Containers carrying animals which can inflict poisonous or venomous bites and stings must be boldly marked "POISONOUS" or "VENOMOUS".  p 
 p Poisonous or venomous animals should be double-packed to prevent escape. Vehicles or containers carrying animals that can possibly inflict injury must have an additional warning label "This Animal Bites" or "Dangerous Animal". a id="2_5" name="2_5"    a   p 
 p style="text-align: right"  a href="#top"   img border="0" height="9" src=" sites default files eng graphics top.gif" width="28"    a   p 
 p  strong 2.5. Persons accompanying transports  strong   p 
 p Personnel accompanying and handling animals should be appropriately trained and competent for this purpose and should carry out their duties diligently without using methods likely to cause unnecessary fear, injury, damage to health or suffering of the animal(s) or any personnel connected with the transport.  p 
 p It is strongly recommended that appropriate training and experience with the respective species be a prerequisite for any person accompanying shipments of that animal and any person handling that animal during and after transport.  p 
 p No person should transport animals or cause animals to be transported in a way likely to cause unnecessary fear, injury, damage to health, suffering or cruel treatment.  p 
 p An individual deemed competent to accompany a shipment of live animals should possess the following, as appropriate to the species:  p 
 p style="text-align: right"  a href="#top"   img border="0" height="9" src=" sites default files eng graphics top.gif" width="28"    a   p 
 p All accompanying personnel should possess a valid passport with visas or equivalent identifying documents as required, and means of communication.  p 
 p  strong 2.6. Loading and unloading  strong   p 
 p The loading and unloading facilities should be adequately designed, constructed, maintained, and operated so as to avoid unnecessary fear, injury, damage to health, suffering, cruel treatment, and to ensure the safety of the animals.  p 
 p Appropriate surfaces and appropriate protections shall be provided so as to prevent animals from escaping.  p 
 p If ramps are used in the process of loading and unloading they should be installed at a height and angle appropriate for the species, and be so designed as to ensure that the animals can traverse it without risks or difficulties.  p 
 p All necessary facilities and equipment for crating, hoisting of containers, loading and unloading should be in place and readily available to minimize the time for loading and unloading, to ensure the animal‘s welfare, and to minimize the risk of unnecessary fear, injury, damage to health, suffering and cruel treatment.  p 
 p Goods such as feed which are being transported in the same conveyance as animals must be positioned and secured so that they do not interfere with the transport of the animals and cause unnecessary fear, injury, damage to health or suffering to the animals.  p 
 p Advance arrangements should be made so that all appropriate equipment and personnel are in place at the place of destination at the estimated time of arrival to ensure quick and safe unloading of all animals.  p 
 p Appropriate lighting should be provided during loading and unloading.  p 
 p It is essential that specific measures are implemented to safeguard the health and welfare of animals and all personnel during and after loading and unloading.  p 
 p When containers loaded with animals are stacked on top of each other on the conveyance, the necessary precautions shall be taken:  p 
 p This may not apply to animals from proven compatible groups, animals that are acclimated to each other and or where separation will cause distress, or females accompanied by dependent and or unweaned young.  p 
 p All animals should be checked upon their arrival at the place of destination by experienced and trained handlers and or veterinary personnel.  p 
 p Animals must be moved with care at all times.  p 
 p Appropriate provisions should be taken at the destination to allow transported animals to adapt to its new environment. a id="2_7" name="2_7"    a   p

 p  strong 2.7. During transport  strong   p 
 p Space allowances shall comply with IATA LAR for transports of all modes of transport for up to 48 hours.  p 
 p For taxa described in the "Technical Specifications" of this non-air transport supplement, space allowances should comply with the figures laid out therein.  p 
 p Sufficient ventilation without injurious drafts and adequate protection from the elements must be provided at all times during the transport to ensure that the needs of the animals are fully met. Transporters must take into account the species and number of animals transported, the expected weather conditions during the transport, and the possibility of unexpected stops.  p 
 p Containers should be stored in a way in which ambient conditions are stable and appropriate, and that does not impede ventilation.  p 
 p Food and water provided for animals should be appropriate for the species and the individual‘s size and age. It should be made available, at appropriate intervals, depending on ambient climatic conditions encountered during transport.  p 
 p Food and water should always be offered in a way that is familiar to the animal and that also minimizes contamination.  p 
 p The conveyance should carry a sufficient quantity of appropriate food for the animals during the transport. The food must be protected from the weather and from contaminants such as dust, fuel, exhaust gases and animal excrements.  p 
 p Where specific feeding equipment is used for the feeding of animals, that equipment should be transported in the conveyance.  p 
 p Where feeding equipment is used, it should be so designed that it is not hazardous to the animals, and if necessary, should be affixed to the container or conveyance to prevent its contents from spillage. When the equipment is not in use, it should be stored away from the animals.  p 
 p In the case of two or more animals per compartment, the natural behaviour of the animals, particularly social aspects, must be considered, and food and water should be offered in a way as to be accessible to every animal.  p 
 p An adequate supply of water is essential for most species.  p 
 p The watering devices should be in good working order and be appropriately designed and positioned for the animal in transport.  p 
 p Sufficient and appropriate floor area and height should be provided for the animals, appropriate to their species, their size, number of animals transported, and the anticipated duration of the transport.  p 
 p The transport should be carried out without delay to the destination and the welfare conditions of the animals must be regularly checked and appropriately maintained by competent personnel.  p 
 p In case of a delay during transport, all necessary actions required to safeguard the welfare of the animals and reduce the risk of unnecessary fear, injury, damage to health and suffering should be taken by the transporter.  p 
 p Appropriate climate conditions and control must be provided with respect to the particular species and must be maintained throughout the transport-taking into consideration possible heat and wind chill factors, weather conditions, and the possibility of unexpected stops.  p 
 p Appropriate surveillance systems should monitor the temperatures of the compartments of the transported animals at all times and alert the transporter when the temperature in the compartments where animals are located falls outside of the recommended maximum or minimum ranges..  p 
 p Animals should be offered a rest period at suitable intervals depending on the species and length of transport, and offered appropriate food and water.  p 
 p When animals fall ill or are injured during transport, they should receive appropriate veterinary treatment as soon as possible and, if necessary, undergo emergency euthanasia in a way which does not cause them any unnecessary suffering in compliance with legislation as applicable.  p 
 p Waste material that contains organic material produced by the animal, animal feed or bedding material, must be handled, collected and disposed of in compliance with applicable legislation regulation. The legislation regulation of some countries may prohibit the use of certain organic materials such as hay, straw, and other animal feed. Unloading organic waste may be restricted or prohibited in some countries. Appropriate measures may be taken to store such waste safely and securely for the duration of transit. a id="3" name="3"    a   p
