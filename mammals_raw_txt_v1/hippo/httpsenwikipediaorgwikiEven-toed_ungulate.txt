 p The  b even-toed ungulates  b  ( b Artiodactyla  b , from  a href=" wiki Ancient_Greek_language" class="mw-redirect" title="Ancient Greek language" Ancient Greek  a   i    i ἄρτιος i  (ártios)  i , meaning 'even', and  i    i δάκτυλος i  (dáktylos)  i , meaning 'finger toe') are  a href=" wiki Ungulate" title="Ungulate" ungulates  a  - hoofed animals - which bear weight equally on two (an even number) of the five toes: their third and fourth toes. The other three toes are either present, absent,  a href=" wiki Vestigial" class="mw-redirect" title="Vestigial" vestigial  a , or pointing posteriorly. By contrast,  a href=" wiki Odd-toed_ungulate" title="Odd-toed ungulate" odd-toed ungulates  a  bear weight on one (an odd number) of the five toes: the third toe. Another difference between the two is that even-toed ungulates digest plant cellulose in one or more stomach chambers rather than in their  a href=" wiki Intestine" class="mw-redirect" title="Intestine" intestine  a  as the odd-toed ungulates do.
  p 
 p The aquatic  a href=" wiki Cetacea" title="Cetacea" cetaceans  a  ( a href=" wiki Whale" title="Whale" whales  a , dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulates, so modern taxonomic classification sometimes combines the Artiodactyla and Cetacea into the  b Cetartiodactyla  b .
  p 
 p The roughly 220 land-based even-toed ungulate species include  a href=" wiki Pig" title="Pig" pigs  a ,  a href=" wiki Peccary" title="Peccary" peccaries  a ,  a href=" wiki Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus" hippopotamuses  a ,  a href=" wiki Camel" title="Camel" camels  a ,  a href=" wiki Llama" title="Llama" llamas  a ,  a href=" wiki Alpaca" title="Alpaca" alpacas  a ,  a href=" wiki Mouse_deer" class="mw-redirect" title="Mouse deer" mouse deer  a ,  a href=" wiki Deer" title="Deer" deer  a ,  a href=" wiki Giraffe" title="Giraffe" giraffes  a ,  a href=" wiki Antelope" title="Antelope" antelopes  a ,  a href=" wiki Sheep" title="Sheep" sheep  a ,  a href=" wiki Goat" title="Goat" goats  a , and  a href=" wiki Cattle" title="Cattle" cattle  a .

The oldest fossils of even-toed ungulates date back to the early  a href=" wiki Eocene" title="Eocene" Eocene  a  (about 53 million years ago). Since these findings almost simultaneously appeared in Europe, Asia, and North America, it is very difficult to accurately determine the origin of artiodactyls. The fossils are classified as belonging to the family  a href=" wiki Dichobunidae" title="Dichobunidae" Dichobunidae  a ; their best-known and best-preserved member is  i  a href=" wiki Diacodexis" title="Diacodexis" Diacodexis  a   i . sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-2" [2]  a   sup  These were small animals, some as small as a  a href=" wiki Hare" title="Hare" hare  a , with a slim build, lanky legs, and a long tail. Their hind legs were much longer than their front legs. The  a href=" wiki Early_Eocene" class="mw-redirect" title="Early Eocene" early  a  to middle Eocene saw the emergence of the ancestors of most of today's mammals. sup id="cite_ref-spaulding2009_3-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-spaulding2009-3" [3]  a   sup   p 
 p Two formerly widespread, but now extinct, families of even-toed ungulates were  a href=" wiki Entelodont" title="Entelodont" Enteledontidae  a  and  a href=" wiki Anthracotheriidae" title="Anthracotheriidae" Anthracotheriidae  a . Entelodonts existed from the middle Eocene to the  a href=" wiki Early_Miocene" title="Early Miocene" early Miocene  a  in  a href=" wiki Eurasia" title="Eurasia" Eurasia  a  and North America. They had a stocky body with short legs and a massive head, which was characterized by two humps on the lower jaw bone. Anthracotheres had a large,  a href=" wiki Porcine" class="mw-redirect" title="Porcine" porcine  a  (pig-like) build, with short legs and an elongated  a href=" wiki Snout" title="Snout" muzzle  a . This group appeared in the middle Eocene up until the  a href=" wiki Pliocene" title="Pliocene" Pliocene  a , and spread throughout Eurasia, Africa, and North America. Anthracothereres are thought to be the ancestors of hippos, and, likewise, probably led a similar aquatic lifestyle. Hippopotamuses appeared in the  a href=" wiki Late_Miocene" title="Late Miocene" late Miocene  a  and occupied Africa and Asia – they never got to the Americas. sup id="cite_ref-spaulding2009_3-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-spaulding2009-3" [3]  a   sup

 p The camels ( a href=" wiki Tylopoda" title="Tylopoda" Tylopoda  a ) were, during large parts of the  a href=" wiki Cenozoic" title="Cenozoic" Cenozoic  a , limited to North America; early forms like  a href=" wiki Cainotheriidae" class="mw-redirect" title="Cainotheriidae" Cainotheriidae  a  occupied Europe. Among the North American camels were groups like the stocky, short-legged  a href=" wiki Merycoidodontidae" class="mw-redirect" title="Merycoidodontidae" Merycoidodontidae  a . They first appeared in the late Eocene and developed a great diversity of species in North America. Only in the late Miocene or early Pliocene did they migrate from North America into Eurasia. The  a href=" wiki List_of_mammals_of_North_America#Camelidae" title="List of mammals of North America" North American varieties  a  became extinct around 10,000 years ago.

 p  a href=" wiki Suina" title="Suina" Suina  a  (including  a href=" wiki Pig" title="Pig" pigs  a ) have been around since the Eocene. In the late Eocene or the  a href=" wiki Oligocene" title="Oligocene" Oligocene  a , two families stayed in Eurasia and Africa; the  a href=" wiki Peccary" title="Peccary" peccaries  a , which became extinct in the  a href=" wiki Old_World" title="Old World" Old World  a , exist today only in the  a href=" wiki Americas" title="Americas" Americas  a .

With only the peccaries, lamoids (or  a href=" wiki Llama" title="Llama" llamas  a ), and various species of  a href=" wiki Capreolinae" title="Capreolinae" capreoline deer  a , South America has  a href=" wiki List_of_mammals_of_South_America#Order:_Artiodactyla_(even-toed_ungulates_and_cetaceans)" title="List of mammals of South America" comparatively fewer artiodactyl families  a  than other continents, except Australia, which has no native species.
  p 
 p The classification of artiodactyls was hotly debated because the ocean-dwelling  a href=" wiki Cetacea" title="Cetacea" cetaceans  a  evolved from the land-dwelling even-toed ungulates. Some  a href=" wiki List_of_semiaquatic_tetrapods" title="List of semiaquatic tetrapods" semiaquatic  a  even-toed ungulates ( a href=" wiki Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus" hippopotamuses  a ) are more closely related to the ocean-dwelling cetaceans than to the other even-toed ungulates.
  p 
 p This makes the Artiodactyla as traditionally defined a  a href=" wiki Paraphyletic" class="mw-redirect" title="Paraphyletic" paraphyletic  a  taxon, since it includes animals descended from a  a href=" wiki Common_ancestor" class="mw-redirect" title="Common ancestor" common ancestor  a , but does not include all of its descendants. Phylogenetic classification only recognizes  a href=" wiki Monophyletic" class="mw-redirect" title="Monophyletic" monophyletic  a  taxa; that is, groups that descend from a common ancestor and include all of its descendants. To address this problem, the traditional order Artiodactyla and infraorder  a href=" wiki Cetacea" title="Cetacea" Cetacea  a  are sometimes subsumed into the more inclusive  a href=" wiki Cetartiodactyla" class="mw-redirect" title="Cetartiodactyla" Cetartiodactyla  a  taxon. sup id="cite_ref-montgelard97_1-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-montgelard97-1" [1]  a   sup  An alternative approach is to include both land-dwelling even-toed ungulates and ocean-dwelling cetaceans in a revised Artiodactyla taxon. sup id="cite_ref-spaulding2009_3-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-spaulding2009-3" [3]  a   sup

 p In the 1990s,  a href=" wiki Systematics" title="Systematics" biological systematics  a  used not only morphology and fossils to classify organisms, but also  a href=" wiki Molecular_biology" title="Molecular biology" molecular biology  a . Molecular biology involves sequencing an organism's DNA and RNA and comparing the sequence with that of other living beings – the more similar they are, the more closely they are related. Comparison of even-toed ungulate and cetaceans genetic material has shown that the closest living relatives of  a href=" wiki Whale" title="Whale" whales  a  and  a href=" wiki Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus" hippopotamuses  a  is the paraphyletic group Artiodactyla.
  p

They were both  a href=" wiki Archaeocete" class="mw-redirect" title="Archaeocete" archaeocetes  a  ("ancient whales") from about 48 million years ago (in the Eocene).

 p The oldest cetaceans date back to the early Eocene (53 million years ago), whereas the oldest known hippopotamus dates back only to the Miocene (15 million years ago). Some doubts have arisen regarding the relationship between the two, as there is a 40 million year gap between their first appearances in the fossil record. It seems unlikely that there were ancestral hippos that left no remains, given the high number of even-toed ungulate fossils. Some studies proposed the late emergence of hippos is because they are relatives of peccaries and split recently, but molecular findings contradict this. Research is therefore focused on anthracortheres (family Anthracotheriidae); one dating from the Eocene to Miocene was declared to be "hippo-like" upon discovery in the 19th century. A study from 2005 showed that the anthracotheres and hippopotamuses have very similar  a href=" wiki Skull" title="Skull" skulls  a , but differed in the adaptations of their teeth. It was nevertheless believed that cetaceans and anthracothereres descended from a common ancestor, and that hippopotamuses developed from anthracotheres. A study published in 2015 was able to confirm this, but also revealed that hippopotamuses were derived from older anthracotheriens. sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_10-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-10" [10]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_15-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-ReferenceB-15" [15]  a   sup  The newly introduced genus  i  a href=" w index.php?title=Epirigenys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Epirigenys (page does not exist)" Epirigenys  a   i  from eastern Africa is thus the sister group of hippos.

Thus, they were grouped together as non-ruminants (Porcine).

 p The idea that ruminants are more closely related to whales and hippos than to the other even-toed ungulates has so far only been explored by molecular biology, but not investigated morphologically, and is therefore controversial.
  p 
 p The presumed lineages within Cetartiodactyla can be represented in the following  a href=" wiki Cladogram" title="Cladogram" cladogram  a : sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-18" [18]  a   sup

 p The four summarized Cetartiodactyla taxa are divided into ten extant families: sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-19" [19]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Although deer, musk deer, and pronghorns have traditionally been summarized as cervids (Cervioidea), molecular studies provide different -– and inconsistent – results, so the question of phylogenetic systematics of infraorder  a href=" wiki Pecora" title="Pecora" Pecora  a  (the horned ruminants) for the time being, cannot be answered.
  p 
 p In December 2007, Hans  a href=" wiki Hans_Thewissen" title="Hans Thewissen" Thewissen  a , professor at Northeastern Ohio University, hypothesized an alternative family tree. According to his studies, the next of kin of early whales was a now-extinct family called  a href=" wiki Raoellidae" title="Raoellidae" Raoellidae  a , and both taxa put together form the sister group of the remaining artiodactyls, including hippos. His findings come from the study of a new skeleton found in  a href=" wiki Kashmir" title="Kashmir" Kashmir  a . It was a member of the genus  i  a href=" wiki Indohyus" title="Indohyus" Indohyus  a   i , which is a member of the Raoellidae. The relationship to whales was established largely due to the presence of a bony ring on the  a href=" wiki Temporal_bone" title="Temporal bone" temporal bone  a  called the  a href=" wiki Involucrum" title="Involucrum" involucrum  a , which was previously associated only with cetaceans; there are also certain shared features of the  a href=" wiki Premolar" title="Premolar" premolars  a  and bone structure. sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-21" [21]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Artiodactyls are generally  a href=" wiki Quadruped" class="mw-redirect" title="Quadruped" quadrupeds  a . Two major body types are known: Suinas and hippopotamuses are characterized by a stocky body, short legs, and a large head; camels and ruminants, though, have a more slender build and lanky legs. Size varies considerably; the smallest member, the mouse deer, often reaches a body length of only 45 cm (18 in) and a weight of 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb). The largest member, the hippopotamus, can grow up to 5 meters (16 ft) in length and weigh 4.5 metric tons (5.0 short tons), and the giraffe can grow to be 5.5 meters (18 ft) tall and 4.7 meters (15 ft) in body length. All even-toed ungulates display some form of  a href=" wiki Sexual_dimorphism" title="Sexual dimorphism" sexual dimorphism  a : the males are consistently larger and heavier than the females. In deer, only the males boast antlers, and the horns of  a href=" wiki Bovines" class="mw-redirect" title="Bovines" bovines  a  are usually small or not present in females. Male  a href=" wiki Blackbuck" title="Blackbuck" Indian antelopes  a  have a much darker coat than females.
  p 
 p Almost all even-toed ungulates have fur, with an exception being the nearly hairless hippopotamus. Fur varies in length and coloration depending on the habitat. Species in cooler regions can shed their coat. Camouflaged coats come in colors of yellow, gray, brown, or black tones.
  p 
 p Even-toed ungulates bear their name because they have an even number of  a href=" wiki Toe" title="Toe" toes  a  (two or four) – in some peccaries, the  a href=" wiki Hind_legs" class="mw-redirect" title="Hind legs" hind legs  a  have a reduction in the number of toes to three. The central axis of the leg is between the third and fourth toe. The first toe is missing in modern artiodactyls, and can only be found in now-extinct genera. The second and fifth toes are adapted differently between species: in the hippos, they are directed forward and fully functional; for the other even-toed ungulates, they face backwards or are completely reduced. For pigs and deer, the toes are still in contact with soft, muddy ground and increase the contact surface area. sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;" [ i  a href=" wiki Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"  span title="Significance? (September 2016)" clarification needed  span   a   i ]  sup  In most cases, however, they no longer touch the ground. In some groups, like the camels and giraffes, regression has progressed so far that the second and fifth toe are not even present.
  p 
 p Hippopotamuses have all four toes pointing out
  p 
 p For pigs and many other biungulates, the second and fifth toes are directed backwards
  p 
 p When camels have only two toes present, the claws are transformed into nails.
  p 
 p When camels have only two toes present, the  a href=" wiki Claw" title="Claw" claws  a  are transformed into  a href=" wiki Nail_(anatomy)" title="Nail (anatomy)" nails  a  (while both are made of  a href=" wiki Keratin" title="Keratin" keratin  a , claws are curved and pointed while nails are flat and dull). sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-22" [22]  a   sup  These claws consist of three parts: the plate (top and sides), the sole (bottom), and the bale (rear). In general, the claws of the forelegs are wider and blunter than those of the hind legs, and the gape is farther apart. Aside from camels, all even-toed ungulates put just the tip of the foremost  a href=" wiki Phalanx" title="Phalanx" phalanx  a  on the ground. sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-23" [23]  a   sup 
  p 
 p In even-toed ungulates, the bones of the stylopodium (upper arm or thigh bone) and  a href=" wiki Forearm" title="Forearm" zygopodiums  a  (tibia and fibula) are usually elongated. The muscles of the limbs are predominantly localized, which ensures that artiodactyls often have very slender legs. A  a href=" wiki Clavicle" title="Clavicle" clavicle  a  is never present, and the  a href=" wiki Scapula" title="Scapula" scapula  a  is very agile and swings back and forth for added mobility when running. The special construction of the legs causes the legs to be unable to rotate, which allows for greater stability when running at high speeds. In addition, many smaller artiodactyls have a very flexible body, contributing to their speed by increasing their stride length.
  p 
 p Many even-toed ungulates have a relatively large head. The skull is elongated and rather narrow; the  a href=" wiki Frontal_bone" title="Frontal bone" frontal bone  a  is enlarged near the back and displaces the  a href=" wiki Parietal_bone" title="Parietal bone" parietal bone  a , which forms only part of the side of the cranium (especially in ruminants).
  p 
 p Four families of even-toed ungulates have cranial appendages. These  a href=" wiki Pecora" title="Pecora" Pecora  a , (with the exception of the  a href=" wiki Musk_deer" title="Musk deer" musk deer  a ), have one of four types of cranial appendages: true horns,  a href=" wiki Antler" title="Antler" antlers  a ,  a href=" wiki Ossicone" title="Ossicone" ossicones  a , or  a href=" wiki Pronghorn" title="Pronghorn" pronghorns  a . sup id="cite_ref-DeMiguel_24-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-DeMiguel-24" [24]  a   sup 
  p 
 p  i True horns  i  have a bone core that is covered in a permanent sheath of keratin, and are found only in the  a href=" wiki Bovidae" title="Bovidae" bovids  a .  i Antlers  i  are bony structures that are shed and replaced each year; they are found in deer (members of the family  a href=" wiki Cervidae" class="mw-redirect" title="Cervidae" Cervidae  a ). They grow from a permanent outgrowth of the frontal bone called the pedicle and can be branched, as in the white-tailed deer ( i  a href=" wiki Odocoileus_virginianus" class="mw-redirect" title="Odocoileus virginianus" Odocoileus virginianus  a   i ), or  a class="external text" href="https:  en.wiktionary.org wiki palmate" palmate  a , as in the moose ( i  a href=" wiki Alces_alces" class="mw-redirect" title="Alces alces" Alces alces  a   i ).  i Ossicones  i  are permanent bone structures that fuse to the frontal or parietal bones during an animal's life and are found only in the  a href=" wiki Giraffidae" title="Giraffidae" Giraffidae  a .  i Pronghorns  i , while similar to horns in that they have keratinous sheaths covering permanent bone cores, are deciduous. sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="margin-left:0.1em; white-space:nowrap;" [ i  a href=" wiki Wikipedia:Please_clarify" title="Wikipedia:Please clarify"  span title="Deciduous as in shed seasonally, or deciduous as in temporary (like baby teeth)?

  p 
 p All these cranial appendages can serve for posturing, battling for mating privilege, and for defense. In almost all cases, they are sexually dimorphic, and often found only on the males.
  p 
 p There are two trends in terms of teeth within Artiodactyla. The Suina and hippopotamuses have a relatively large number of teeth (with some pigs having 44); their dentition is more adapted to a squeezing  a href=" wiki Mastication" class="mw-redirect" title="Mastication" mastication  a , which is characteristic of  a href=" wiki Omnivore" title="Omnivore" omnivores  a . Camels and ruminants have fewer teeth; there is often a yawning  a href=" wiki Diastema" title="Diastema" diastema  a , a designated gap in the teeth where the molars are aligned for crushing plant matter.
  p 
 p The  a href=" wiki Incisor" title="Incisor" incisors  a  are often reduced in ruminants, and are completely absent in the  a href=" wiki Upper_jaw" class="mw-redirect" title="Upper jaw" upper jaw  a . The canines are enlarged and tusk-like in the Suina, and are used for digging in the ground and for defense. In ruminants, the males' upper canines are enlarged and used as a weapon in certain species (mouse deer, musk deer,  a href=" wiki Water_deer" title="Water deer" water deer  a ); species with frontal weapons are usually missing the upper canines. The lower canines of ruminants resemble the incisors, so that these animals have eight uniform teeth in the frontal part of the  a href=" wiki Lower_jaw" class="mw-redirect" title="Lower jaw" lower jaw  a .
  p 
 p The molars of porcine have only a few bumps. In contrast, the camels and ruminants have bumps that are crescent-shaped cusps ( a href=" wiki Selenodont" title="Selenodont" selenodont  a ).
  p 
 p Artiodactyls have a well-developed sense of smell and sense of hearing. Unlike many other mammals, they have a poor sense of sight – moving objects are much easier to see than stationary ones. Similar to many other prey animals, their eyes are on the sides of the head, giving them an almost panoramic view.
  p 
 p The  a href=" wiki Ruminant" title="Ruminant" ruminants  a  (Ruminantia and Tylopoda) ruminate their food – they regurgitate and re-chew it. Ruminants' mouths often have additional  a href=" wiki Salivary_gland" title="Salivary gland" salivary glands  a , and the  a href=" wiki Oral_mucosa" title="Oral mucosa" oral mucosa  a  is often heavily calloused to avoid injury from hard plant parts and to allow easier transport of roughly chewed food. Their stomachs are divided into three to four sections: the  a href=" wiki Rumen" title="Rumen" rumen  a , the  a href=" wiki Reticulum" title="Reticulum" reticulum  a , the  a href=" wiki Omasum" title="Omasum" omasum  a , and the  a href=" wiki Abomasum" title="Abomasum" abomasum  a . sup id="cite_ref-EoM_26-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-EoM-26" [26]  a   sup  After the food is ingested, it is mixed with saliva in the  a href=" wiki Rumen" title="Rumen" rumen  a  and  a href=" wiki Reticulum" title="Reticulum" reticulum  a  and separates into layers of solid versus liquid material. The solids lump together to form a  a href=" wiki Bolus_(digestion)" title="Bolus (digestion)" bolus  a  (also known as the  a href=" wiki Cud" title="Cud" cud  a ); this is regurgitated by reticular contractions while the  a href=" wiki Glottis" title="Glottis" glottis  a  is closed. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and re-swallowed. The bolus is chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break it down. Ingested food passes to the "fermentation chamber" (rumen and reticulum), where it is kept in continual motion by rhythmic contractions. Cellulytic  a href=" wiki Microbe" class="mw-redirect" title="Microbe" microbes  a  ( a href=" wiki Bacteria" title="Bacteria" bacteria  a ,  a href=" wiki Protozoa" title="Protozoa" protozoa  a , and  a href=" wiki Fungus" title="Fungus" fungi  a ) produce  a href=" wiki Cellulase" title="Cellulase" cellulase  a , which is needed to break down the cellulose found in plant material. sup id="cite_ref-EoM_26-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-EoM-26" [26]  a   sup  This form of digestion has two advantages: plants that are indigestible to other species can be digested and used, and the duration of the actual food consumption shortened; the animal spends only a short time out in the open with his head to the ground – rumination can take place later, in a sheltered area. sup id="cite_ref-Shively1985_27-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Shively1985-27" [27]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Tylopoda (camels, llamas, and alpacas) and chevrotains have three-chambered stomachs, while the rest of Ruminantia have four-chambered stomachs. The handicap of a heavy digestive system has increased selective pressure towards limbs that allow the animal to quickly escape predators. sup id="cite_ref-britannica_28-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-britannica-28" [28]  a   sup  Most species within Suina have a simple two-chambered stomach that allows an omnivorous diet.

 p Generally, even-toed ungulates tend to have long  a href=" wiki Gestation_period" class="mw-redirect" title="Gestation period" gestation periods  a , smaller litter sizes, and more highly developed newborns. As with many other mammals, species in  a href=" wiki Temperate_climate" title="Temperate climate" temperate  a  or  a href=" wiki Polar_climate" title="Polar climate" polar  a  regions have a fixed  a href=" wiki Mating_season" class="mw-redirect" title="Mating season" mating season  a , while those in  a href=" wiki Tropics" title="Tropics" tropical  a  areas breed year-round. They carry out polygynous mating behavior, meaning a male mates with several females and suppresses all competition.
  p 
 p The length of the gestation period varies from four to five months for porcine, deer, and musk deer; six to ten months for hippos, deer, and bovines; ten to thirteen months with camels; and fourteen to fifteen months with giraffes. Most deliver one or two babies, but some pigs can deliver up to ten.
  p 
 p The newborns are  a href=" wiki Precocial" class="mw-redirect" title="Precocial" precocial  a  (born relatively mature) and come with open eyes and are hairy (with the exception of the hairless hippos). Juvenile deer and pigs have striped or spotted coats; the pattern disappears as they grow older. The juveniles of some species spend their first weeks with their mother in a safe location, where others may be running and following the herd within a few hours or days.
  p 
 p The life expectancy is typically twenty to thirty years; as in many mammals, smaller species often have a shorter lifespan than larger species. The artiodactyls with the longest lifespans are the hippos, cows, and camels, which can live 40 to 50 years.
  p 
 p Artiodactyls have different  a href=" wiki Natural_predator" class="mw-redirect" title="Natural predator" natural predators  a  depending on their size and habitat. There are several  a href=" wiki Carnivore" title="Carnivore" carnivores  a  that would prey on such animals, including as  a href=" wiki Large_cat" class="mw-redirect" title="Large cat" large cats  a  (e.g.,  a href=" wiki Lion" title="Lion" lions  a ) and  a href=" wiki Bear" title="Bear" bears  a .

  p 
 p Artiodactyls have been hunted by primitive humans for various reasons: for meat or  a href=" wiki Fur_clothing" title="Fur clothing" fur  a , as well as to use their forehead weapons, bones, and teeth as weapons or tools. Their  a href=" wiki Domestication" title="Domestication" domestication  a  began around 8000 BCE. To date, humans have domesticated goats, sheep, cattle, camels, llamas, alpacas, and pigs. Initially, livestock was used primarily for food, but they began being used for work activities around 3000 BCE. sup id="cite_ref-britannica_28-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-britannica-28" [28]  a   sup  Clear evidence exists of antelope being used for food 2 million years ago in the  a href=" wiki Olduvai_Gorge" title="Olduvai Gorge" Olduvai Gorge  a , part of the  a href=" wiki Kenyan_Rift_Valley" class="mw-redirect" title="Kenyan Rift Valley" Great Rift Valley  a . sup id="cite_ref-britannica_28-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-britannica-28" [28]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-35" [35]  a   sup   a href=" wiki Cro-Magnon" class="mw-redirect" title="Cro-Magnon" Cro-Magnons  a  relied heavily on reindeer for food, skins, tools, and weapons; with dropping temperatures and increased reindeer numbers at the end of the Pleistocene, they became the prey of choice. Reindeer remains accounted for 94% of bones and teeth found in a cave above the  a href=" wiki C%C3%A9ou_River" class="mw-redirect" title="Céou River" Céou River  a  that was inhabited around 12,500 years ago. sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-36" [36]  a   sup

 p The endangerment level of each even-toed ungulate is different. Some species are  a href=" wiki Synanthropic" class="mw-redirect" title="Synanthropic" synanthropic  a  (such as the  a href=" wiki Wild_boar" title="Wild boar" wild boar  a ) and have spread into areas that they are not indigenous to, either having been brought as farm animals or having run away as people's pets. Some artiodactyls also benefit from the fact that their predators (e.g. the  a href=" wiki Thylacine" title="Thylacine" Tasmanian tiger  a ) were severely decimated by ranchers, who saw them as competition. sup id="cite_ref-Pough2005_34-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Pough2005-34" [34]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Conversely, many artiodactyls have declined significantly in numbers, and some have even gone extinct, largely due to  a href=" wiki Over-hunting" class="mw-redirect" title="Over-hunting" over-hunting  a , and, more recently,  a href=" wiki Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction" habitat destruction  a . Extinct species include several gazelles (such as the  a href=" wiki Arabian_gazelle" title="Arabian gazelle" Arabian gazelle  a ), the  a href=" wiki Malagasy_hippopotamus" title="Malagasy hippopotamus" Malagasy hippopotamus  a , the  a href=" wiki Bluebuck" title="Bluebuck" bluebuck  a , and  a href=" wiki Schomburgk%27s_deer" title="Schomburgk's deer" Schomburgk's deer  a .
