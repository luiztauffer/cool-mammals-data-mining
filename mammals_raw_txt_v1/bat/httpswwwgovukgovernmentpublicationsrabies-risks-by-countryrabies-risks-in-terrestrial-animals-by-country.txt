 p The country or animal risks shown below represent risks as assessed by Public Health England for use in post-exposure risk assessments. They incorporate the presence or absence of rabies in domestic and wild animals, surveillance systems in place, and consideration of UK traveller behaviour.  p 
 p No indigenous rabies in terrestrial animals.  p 
 p Rabies occurs in wild animals but not in companion animals.  p 
 p Rabies occurs in wild and companion animals (or there are no data to prove otherwise).  p 
 p Bats may carry rabies-like viruses in countries which are declared rabies-free in terrestrial animals. Therefore an exposure to bats or their secretions should be considered as a potential rabies risk wherever in the world this has occurred.  p 
 p All countries worldwide are considered high risk for bat exposures, apart from the UK and Ireland which are low risk for bats.  p 
 p The risk of rabies transmission to humans from primates or rodents is considerably lower than the risks associated with exposures from other animals, particularly carnivores.  p 
 p All countries where rabies is present in terrestrial animals (either low or high risk ratings) are considered low risk for any exposures from primates and rodents.  p 
 p For all other terrestrial animals, use the country listing below.  p
