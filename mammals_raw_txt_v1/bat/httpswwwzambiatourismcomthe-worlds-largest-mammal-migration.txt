 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" While many believe that the great Wildebeest migration in Africa is the largest mammal migration on earth, this is a common misconception. So, what could surpass the over 1.5 million wildebeest trekking between Tanzania and Kenya?  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;"  strong Bats  strong . Yes,  strong bats  strong .  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" Between October and December each year, about  strong 10 million fruit bats  strong  descend into a tiny patch of evergreen, swamp-forest ( em mushitu  em ) inside Kasanka National Park, in Northern Zambia, from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. These are giant fruit bats – also known as flying foxes – with straw-coloured bodies the size of puppies, and wings that span almost three feet. Now imagine 10 million of these (possibly 15 million according so some researchers). That’s an incredible  strong three-metric-tonnes  strong  of bat! And it happens in a pocket of forest no bigger than two or three football pitches.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" They come in search of the waterberries, mangoes, wild loquats and red-milkwood berries that appear in abundance at this time of year. These bats are one of the most important migratory animals when it comes to regenerating the forests of Africa. Each will feast on around two kilograms of fruit nightly, collectively adding up to around  strong 6 000 tonnes  strong  of fruit. The bats then head off on their long migratory path, spreading seeds through dropping their faeces, assisting with the growth and ultimately the regeneration of the land.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" This time in  strong Kasanka National Park  strong  isn’t just great for seeing the bats; with green grass, bright flowers and hordes of migratory birds providing plenty of visual treats. Although this isn’t a spot for scouring out the big five you can often see monkeys, civets, hippos, elephants and even sitatunga.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" This is one of Africa’s most spectacular wildlife secrets, with the  strong shoebill stork  strong  a particularly strong drawcard. There are also wattled crane, sacred ibis, spur-winged goose, and swamp flycatcher, as well as plenty of elephant, buffalo, reedbuck, and massive herds of black lechwe.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" This natural phenomenon, unique to Kasanka, takes place over approximately 90 days from late October to mid-December. Taking place in one area, and only for a short while means that  strong your safari has to be impeccably timed  strong .  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000; font-family: georgia, palatino, serif; font-size: 12pt;" Kasanka even offers amazing treetop-hides perched  strong 20 metres up-in-the-air  strong  in the Bat Forest, allowing you to fully appreciate this unique experience.  span   p
