 p align="left" The 
              gray bat is an endangered species. Endangered Species are animals and 
              plants that are in danger of becoming extinct. Threatened species are 
              animals and plants that are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable 
              future. Identifying, protecting, and restoring, endangered and threatened 
              species is the primary objective of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 
              endangered species program.  p 
 p Gray bats are distinguished from other 
              bats by the unicolored fur on their back. In addition, following their 
              molt in July or August, gray bats have dark gray fur which often bleaches 
              to a chestnut brown or russet. They weigh 7-16 grams. The bat's wing 
              membrane connects to its ankle instead of at the toe, where it is connected 
              in other species of  em Myotis  em .  p 
 p    p 
 p With rare exceptions, gray bats live in 
              caves year-round. During the winter gray bats hibernate in deep, vertical 
              caves. In the summer, they roost in caves which are scattered along 
              rivers. These caves are in limestone karst areas of the southeastern 
              United States. They do not use houses or barns.  p 
 p    p 
 p Females give birth to a single young 
              in late May or early June.  p 
 p    p 
 p The bats eat a variety of flying 
              aquatic and terrestrial insects present along rivers or lakes.  p 
 p    p 
 p The gray bat occupies a limited geographic 
              range in limestone karst areas of the southeastern United States. They 
              are mainly found in Alabama, northern Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, 
              and Tennessee. A few can be found in northwestern Florida, western Georgia, 
              southeastern Kansas, southern Indiana, southern and southwestern Illinois, 
              northeastern Oklahoma, northeastern Mississippi, western Virginia, and 
              possibly western North Carolina.  p 
 p    p 
 p Gray bats are endangered largely 
              because of their habit of living in very large numbers in only a few 
              caves. As a result, they are extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Arousing 
              bats while they are hibernating can cause them to use up a lot of energy, 
              which lowers their energy reserves. If a bat runs out of reserves, it 
              may leave the cave too soon and die. In June and July, when flightless 
              young are present, human disturbance can lead to mortality as frightened 
              females drop their young in the panic to flee from the intruder.  p 
 p    p 
 p Many important caves 
              were flooded and submerged by reservoirs. Other caves are in danger 
              of natural flooding. Even if the bats escape the flood, they have difficulty 
              finding a new cave that is suitable.  p 
 p    p 
 p The commercialization 
              of caves drives bats away. Any gating on the cave that prevents access 
              or alters the air flow, temperature, humidity, and amount of light is 
              harmful.  p 
 p    p 
 p The gray bat was added to the U.S. List 
              of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants on April 28, 1976.  p 
 p    p 
 p The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
              has developed a recovery plan that describes actions needed to help 
              the bat survive.  p 
 p    p 
 p A variety of government and 
              private conservation agencies are all working to preserve gray bats 
              and their caves.  p 
 p    p 
 p Learn more about the gray bat and other endangered 
              and threatened species. Understand how the destruction of habitat leads 
              to loss of endangered and threatened species and our nation's plant 
              and animal diversity. Tell others about what you have learned.  p 
 p    p 
 p Write to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
              or your state fish and game agency to learn more about endangered and 
              threatened species.  p 
 p    p 
 p Join a conservation group; many have local 
              chapters.  p
