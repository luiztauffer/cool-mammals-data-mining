 p Scientists examining museum specimens of bats from South America have found that a distinctive, gold colored species which was previously confused with another bat is actually a species new to science.  p 
 p This striking new species, which is is thought to be  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.asmjournals.org doi abs 10.1644 14-MAMM-149?af=R&amp;" endemic to Bolivia  a , was originally classified as the similar looking species  em Myotis simus  em  which can be found in numerous South American countries. However, after comparing fur color and other external features, scientists noted several important differences between specimens that suggested this species was distinct from other  em Myotis   em species, including  em M. simus  em . In particular, the new species is covered in thick, fluffy golden fur unlike  em M. simus  em  which is more  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bioone.org doi abs 10.1644 892.1" orange-brown  a  in color. This has earned these bats the name  em M. midastactus  em  after  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" King Midas  a  from Greek mythology who could turn anything he touched into gold.   p 
 p  em M. midastactus   em is an  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" insect eater  a  that can be found throughout the Bolivian savanna. They spend their days chilling out under thatched roofs or in holes in the ground made by other animals. There are  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.asmjournals.org doi abs 10.1644 14-MAMM-149?af=R&amp;" six  a  other species in the  em Myotis   em genus living alongside  em M. midastactus   em in Bolivia, but interestingly they couldn’t find any evidence for  em M. simus   em in this country. The  em Myotis   em genus is particularly rich with over  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bioone.org doi abs 10.1644 892.1" 100 species  a  of these so-called mouse-eared bats discovered across the world so far, 15 of which can be found in South America.  p 
 p As described in the  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.asmjournals.org doi abs 10.1644 14-MAMM-149?af=R&amp;"  em Journal of Mammalogy  em   a , the researchers conducted detailed studies of the external features of 27 different specimens kept in museums in both the US and Brazil. Unfortunately, they were unable to catch any live specimens of this animal despite spending months trying. But lead author Dr Ricardo Moratelli points out to the  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" BBC  a  that museum specimens are critical to our understanding of biodiversity on our planet.  p 
 p “I can confidently say that many new species from different zoological groups are in museum cabinets around the world, awaiting recognition and formal description,”  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" said Moratelli  a .  p 
 p Currently, the researchers have insufficient data to be able to determine the  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" conservation status  a  of this species; however, previous work indicated that  em M. simus   em in Bolivia, which is now thought to be  em M. midastactus  em , was near threatened. While they couldn’t find any evidence for  em M. simus   em in Bolivia, this species can be found in several other South American countries including Brazil, Argentina and Peru.  p 
 p Moratelli made these discoveries as part of a  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" large study  a  on mouse-eared bats living in the  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature ecozones Neotropic_ecozone" Neotropical ecozone  a , which is an area incorporating South and Central America, southern Mexico, the Caribbean Islands and Florida. So far, Moratelli has described  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature 28583377" four  a  other  em Myotis   em species that were previously unknown to science.   p
