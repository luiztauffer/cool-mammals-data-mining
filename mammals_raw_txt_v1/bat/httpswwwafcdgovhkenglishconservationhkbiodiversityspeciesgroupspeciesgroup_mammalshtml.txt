 p class="hd"  a name="intro"   a Introduction  p 
 p align="justify" It is thought that Hong Kong was part of a great tropical broad-leave forest with abundant elephants, tigers, wild red dogs, and a wide variety of tropical species about three thousand years ago. However, agriculture and urbanization depleted the natural habitats. Huge forest trees were gradually logged or burned, and some large mammals such as South China Tiger were hunted as they were considered dangerous or man-eaters. As a result, many species that had flourished in Hong Kong began to die out. Fortunately, certain species were able to adapt to these changes. Some survived into the early 1900s and some even today.  br  br How many species of wild terrestrial mammal exist in Hong Kong? Most people would say “not many” as Hong Kong is a physically small city of about 110,000 hectares and famous for its urban landscape and dense human population. Besides, most mammals are nocturnal and avoid humans, so they are seldom seen by casual observers and their presence is likely to be overlooked. The surprising fact is that over fifty species of mammals live in the territory, including some rare and precious ones, like Eurasian Otter and Chinese Pangolin, which can still be found in some protected areas of Hong Kong.  br  br There is no doubt that mammals have a great impact on the ecosystem as they utilize many types of food and occupy various habitats at almost all latitudes. Insectivorous bats, for example, play an essential part in keeping the populations of night-flying insects in balance. A single bat can catch hundreds of insects in an hour and large colonies of bats catch tons of insects in a single evening, including species of beetles and moths that are agricultural pests. Fruit bats have important roles as pollen or seed dispersers too. More than 300 plant species rely on bats for survival. These include the wild relative of economically important crops such as bananas and mangos. Some of these plants bloom at night, using special odors or flower shapes to attract bats. While birds commonly defecate seeds from branches on the edges of forested areas, fruit bats often do so while flying in the open. Therefore, they are more likely to deposit the seeds in more illuminated areas or deforested areas. Bats have been shown to be important seed dispersers of at least three species of local figs, Common Yellow Stem-fig, Opposite-leaved Fig and Common Red-stem Fig. The ripe figs of these bat-dispersed species are green or yellow, do not attract birds and are available year-round.  p

 p align="justify" Some small mammals may also act as effective seed dispersers as they store seeds for later consumption. Some rodents, for example, bury seeds in the soil. If they fail to recover them later, the seeds may germinate and grow. No local rodent is known to disperse seeds by burying them. However two hillside rats have been shown to disperse the seeds of small seed shrubs, such as those of  em Rhodomyrtus  em  and  em Melastoma  em , in their droppings. Large mammals also do their part in seed dispersal as they ingest large quantities of seeds. Some plants produce large and hard fruits which are unattractive to birds, bats and other animals, and are only dispersed by large terrestrial mammals. As large mammals have a long gut passage, such seeds can potentially be dispersed over long distances.  p

 p class="hd"  a name="composition"   a Composition of Hong Kong Terrestrial Mammals  p 
 p align="justify" Among the 57 existing terrestrial mammalian species in Hong Kong, 27 species are bats and 30 species are non-flying mammals. These 30 non-flying species can be further divided into two different groups by size: small mammals with head-and-body length less than 25 cm and large mammals with head-and-body length exceeding 25 cm. All listed species are species recorded occurring in Hong Kong over the past 30 years and are non-pet wild mammals which have established reproducing populations in the urban or wild environments. These also include domesticated species which have established populations in the wild environment.  br  br Bats (order Chiroptera) comprise almost half of the mammal species in Hong Kong. Among them, 14 species are cave dwelling. Ten of these are widely distributed in the water tunnels and abandoned mines of Hong Kong. These include Rickett's Big-footed Myotis and Common Bent-winged Bat which were thought to be either rare or uncommon in the past. Some species are common in both rural and urban areas. For example, Short-nosed Fruit Bat, which roosts under the fronds of the Chinese Fan-palm in parks and playgrounds, and Japanese Pipistrelle, which roosts in man-made structures like air-conditioners. The recently discovered species, Greater Bamboo Bat, is only recorded in the Plover Cove Country Park while Lesser Bamboo Bat is widely distributed throughout Hong Kong. Among the species recorded by mist net surveys, Least Pipistrelle and Lesser Yellow Bat are uncommon species while Whiskered Myotis, Chinese Pipistrelle, Greater Bamboo Bat and an unidentified pipistrelle are rare species. The rare Horsfield's Myotis is restricted inside the weepholes at the water tunnels in Shek Kong, Tung Tze and Nam Chung. There is no record of Daubenton's Myotis, Black-bearded Tomb Bat and Fringed Long-footed Myotis in recent years and the status of these three species is poorly known. Wrinkle-lipped Free-tailed Bat has been recorded in many parts of the urban areas during early winter. However, no roosting site of this species has been found in Hong Kong. The individuals recorded were probably either stray or foraging into Hong Kong from nearby roosting sites outside Hong Kong.  p

 p align="justify" The small land mammals in Hong Kong consist of 2 insectivores, 8 rats and 1 squirrel. Of the insectivores, Musk Shrew is more common than Grey Shrew. Both species are mostly recorded in rural areas. Most rat species are human commensals and are restricted to urban areas, such as Roof Rat and Brown Rat. However, Chestnut Spiny Rat and Indo-Chinese Forest Rat are common hillside rats which seldom enter into buildings. Greater Bandicoot Rat, Lesser Rice-field Rat and Ryuku Mouse are primarily associated with agricultural areas, and have restricted distribution in Hong Kong. Pallas's Squirrel is an introduced species, presumably from a released or escaped pet, which has become established with two different subspecies on Hong Kong Island and in the New Territories.  p

 p align="justify" The remaining 19 species of medium and large mammals consist of 2 large rodents, 2 primates, 10 carnivores, 4 even-toed ungulates and 1 pangolin. Note that the 4 even-toed ungulates do not include Chinese Muntjac, which was previously mistaken as the only muntjac species in Hong Kong. The only cervid species occurred in Hong Kong was found to be Red Muntjac. Among the 19 species, Domestic Cat, Domestic Dog, Domestic Ox, Domestic Water Buffalo and Long-tailed Macaque are introduced species and have low conservation value in Hong Kong. The dominant macaque species is Rhesus Macaque. The estimated total population of Rhesus Macaque is about 2,000 which are mainly distributed in Kam Shan Country Park, Lion Rock Country Park, Shing Mun Country Park and Tai Po Kau Special Area. Although Hong Kong falls within the range of natural distribution of Rhesus Macaque, it is thought that the original wild stock had disappeared and the existing populations are descendents of individuals re-introduced in the early twentieth century. Furthermore, Small Asian Mongoose and Yellow-bellied Weasel, which had not been recorded in Hong Kong until recently, are suspected to have colonized Hong Kong by expanding from nearby areas of their natural range or by accidental or deliberate release of individuals. Hong Kong is within or close to their natural ranges, and it is also possible that they existed in Hong Kong in the past and have now re-colonized Hong Kong after the reforestation of our Country Parks.  br  br   p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p align="justify" Among the native medium and large mammals, East Asian Porcupine and Red Muntjac are the most abundant and widely distributed species in Hong Kong. They were recorded in over 50% of surveyed areas in 2002-06 by camera trapping. Small Indian Civet and Eurasian Wild Pig, which are recorded in over 30% of surveyed areas, are also relatively abundant and widespread. On the other hand, Small-toothed Ferret Badger, Leopard Cat and Masked Palm Civet are less abundant but widely distributed.  p

 p align="justify" Crab-eating Mongoose was thought to be extirpated in Hong Kong during the 1960s. However, small populations were found in the northeast parts of the New Territories recently and adults carrying cubs have also been observed. Chinese Pangolin may be the most spectacular and threatened species in Hong Kong. It has been recorded in many parts of the territory, but its abundance is very low. Prized as a market animal and used as  traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese Pangolin is hunted illegally for its meat and scales. Eurasian Otter is also a rare species with highly restricted distribution. Being semi-aquatic, it requires a clean aquatic system with abundant food supply and is only recorded in the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site.    p 
 p class="hd"  a name="key"   a Key species of Conservation Concern  p 
 p align="justify" According to AFCD baseline surveys, eight mammalian species are ranked as species of conservation concern in Hong Kong due to their rarity and or restricted distribution. These include five species of bats - Horsfield's Myotis, Whiskered Myotis, Greater Bamboo Bat, Chinese Pipistrelle and an unidentified pipistrelle, and three species of large mammals – Crab-eating Mongoose, Chinese Pangolin and Eurasian Otter.  br  br  strong Horsfield's Myotis  strong   br  br Horsfield's Myotis ( em Myotis horsfieldii  em ) is a small-sized Myotis with forearm length shorter than 38mm. It's pelage is dark brown to nearly black above and pale grayish brown below. The eyes and lips have pink bare skin. Canines are well developed. This species favours wooded areas with a supply of freshwater and spends the day secretly in rock crevices or weepholes alone. Recent records are from water tunnels in Shek Kong, Tung Tze and Nam Chung.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p align="justify"  strong Whiskered Myotis  strong   br  br Whiskered Myotis ( em Myotis muricola  em ) is a small-sized myotis with forearm length ranged from 35 to 38 mm. Its pelage is blackish brown above and paler below. Compared to other local myotis species, it has relatively small hindfeet which are less than half the length of its tibia. In other countries, this species was found to roost inside the curled leaves of banana trees. Recent records are from Nam Chung, Ho Pui, Tai Lam and Ma On Shan.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p align="justify"  strong Greater Bamboo Bat  strong   br  br Greater Bamboo Bat ( em Tylonycteris robustula  em ) is a tiny bat with forearm length ranged from 25 to 29 mm. Pelage is dark brown above and slightly paler below. The small body size, flat skull and the presence of cushion-like pads on its thumbs and feet are features for adapting to roosting in thick bamboo stems. It has only been recorded in Plover Cove.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p align="justify"  strong Chinese Pipistrelle  strong   br  br Chinese Pipistrelle ( em Hypsugo pulveratus  em ) is a medium-sized pipistrelle with forearm length ranged from 34 to 36 mm. Pelage is blackish brown above and paler below. Wing membrane, ears and muzzle are dark brown. Compared to Japanese Pipistrelle ( em Pipistrellus abramus  em ) which is very common in Hong Kong, this species has relatively large eyes and elongated ears, penis is short (&lt; 3 mm) for males. It has recently been recorded in Ma On Shan and Ting Kau.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p align="justify"  strong Unidentified Pipistrelle  strong   br  br This species was first discovered in Hong Kong in 2005. This is a large pipistrelle with forearm length exceeds 37 mm. Pelage is brown above with golden collar and paler below. It has only been recorded in Plover Cove.   p

 p align="justify"  strong Crab-eating Mongoose  strong   br  br Crab-eating Mongoose ( em Herpestes urva  em ) is a relatively large mongoose with head-to-body length ranged from 36 to 60 cm. It has a pointed head and a long and tapering bushy tail. It can be distinguished from Small Asian Mongoose ( em Herpestes javanicus  em ) by its tall stance, shaggy brown to grey-brown fur and a long white strip on the shoulder. This diurnal species is rare and has a restricted distribution to the northern part of Hong Kong. It has recently been recorded in Lin Ma Hang, Sha Tau Kok, Pat Sin Leng, Ma On Shan and Plover Cove.  p

 p    p 
 p align="justify"  strong Chinese Pangolin  strong   br  br Chinese Pangolin ( em Manis pentadactyla  em ) is an ant- and termite-eating specialist with head-to-body length ranged from 50 to 90 cm. It has a small pointed head and a long and thick tail. Limbs are stout with large, sharp and recurved claws. It is characterized by overlapping grayish brown scales which cover the entire body, except the belly and the inner sides of the limbs. This makes it looks like wearing an armor. The scales are made of agglutinated hair and has razor-sharp edges for defence against predators. When threatened, the Chinese Pangolin curls up into a ball and raises its scales.  p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p  strong Eurasian Otter  strong   p 
 p align="justify" Eurasian Otter ( em Lutra lutra chinensis  em ) is a smart and playful semi-aquatic mammal. It is characterized by an elongated body and broad flattened head with naked nose pad. It also has low, rounded ears, thick neck and a long and muscular tail. The limbs are short with webbed toes for swimming. The long whiskers are used for detecting prey under water. This species is only found at the Mai Po Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site.  p 
 p class="hd"  a name="conservation"   a Conservation Measures  p 
 p align="justify" Effective wildlife conservation relies on gathering information to identify changes over time in the populations of concern. However, much of our data of Hong Kong mammals has been collected using different survey methodologies and the historical data are insufficient to serve as a baseline against which population changes over time can be assessed. In view of this, AFCD launched a long term monitoring program of Hong Kong mammals in 2002. The objectives are to estimate the number of species, species abundance and spatial distributions of mammalian species throughout Hong Kong, and to provide baseline information to identify changes in populations of species of conservation concern.   p 
 p    p 
 p    p 
 p align="justify"  a href="https:  www.elegislation.gov.hk hk cap170!en" Wild Animals Protection Ordinance (Cap. 170)  a  is enforced to protect local wild animals, including most of the native terrestrial mammals. No person shall, except in accordance with a special permit, hunt or willfully disturb, buy, sell, export or offer for sale or export, have in his possession or under his control any protected wild animals. In 1999, the Lion Rock, Kam Shan, Shing Mun and part of Tai Mo Shan Country Parks and Tai Po Kau Special Area and some of the nearby areas were designated as places where feeding of any wild animals including wild monkeys is prohibited. Moreover, the  a href="https:  www.elegislation.gov.hk hk cap586!en" Protection of Endangered Species of Animals and Plants Ordinance (Cap. 586)  a  is the Ordinance which gives effect to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The import, introduction from the sea, export, re-export and possession or control in endangered species of animals and plants, including their parts and derivatives, are subject to control in line with CITES under the Ordinance. Endangered local species include Chinese Pangolin, Rhesus Macaque and Eurasian Otter.  p 
 p align="justify" To improve public's knowledge on the diversity and conservation of the mammals of Hong Kong, publicity and education programmes have been carried out. These include organizing seminars, launching websites, publishing newsletters and field guide on the terrestrial mammals of Hong Kong.  p

 p class="hd"  a name="keysites"   a Key sites for Observing Terrestrial Mammals  p 
 p align="justify" Observing terrestrial mammals is very challenging as most mammals are nocturnal, extremely secretive and avoid humans. They are seldom seen by casual observers and are likely to be overlooked.  br  br Seeing diurnal mammals such as Pallas's Squirrel or Rhesus Macaque is easier as one only has to visit their habitat with a pair of binoculars (and some patience!). Observing nocturnal species, however, is much more difficult. Based on the result of camera trap surveys, the chance of seeing a nocturnal mammal in the Hong Kong countryside is slim. The relative occurrence rates of the two most common mammals, Red Muntjac and East Asian Porcupine, were estimated to be 11 to 16, meaning that a person observing in a rural area for 100 days might see about 11 to 16 numbers of Red Muntjac or East Asian Porcupine pass by. For some rarer species, the relative occurrence rates were about 0.1, meaning that one might have to wait over 1,000 days to catch a glimpse of them! Besides, it should be remembered that relative occurrence rates are only estimates of the occurrence of the mammals by camera traps, the actual occurrence should depend on factors like observer experience, locality, species, field conditions and time.  br  br Relatively speaking, it is easier to find mammals by searching their footprints and other signs, so it is possible to know what species are present without actually seeing them. To know which mammals are present in a countryside area, the first step is to find “animal paths”. Animal Paths are narrow paths winding across the fields and into woods or tunnels in grass and undergrowth. These paths indicate the daily routes of most mammals and it is easier to find other clues near them. The next step is to search for signs such as footprints, droppings, food debris and other animal residue, which can help to identify the mammals, around the animal paths. Footprints are mostly found on soft surfaces and it is easier to find complete footprints in soft mud or sand next to streams. The scats of some species can easily be identified, such as the scats of East Asian Porcupine, Red Muntjac or Domestic Ox. If you are lucky, you may also find body parts of the mammals, such as the rattle quills of East Asian Porcupines or the hairs of Eurasian Wild Pigs. More experienced observers may be able to locate the species by the sounds they produce, such as the hoarse bark, “erk erk erk”, which Red Muntjacs make when alarmed.  p

 p    p 
 p align="justify"  strong Macaques in Hong Kong  strong   br  br You may have encountered some monkeys or macaques in Kam Shan or Shing Mun Country Parks in the past, but you may not have noticed that there are different "types" of monkey occurring there. The most common species there is Rhesus Macaque which is mainly distributed in Kam Shan Country Parks, Shing Mun Country Parks and Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve. Some hybrid individuals of Rhesus Macaque and Longtailed Macaque, showing intermediate characteristics of both species, would also be found in the above areas. The best place to observe these two types of macaques is along the Education Trail in Kam Shan Country Park. In addition to Rhesus Macaque and the hybrids, you may encounter some golden macaques which are the special pelage form of Rhesus Macaque.  p

 p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;" align="justify" Most macaques have a multimale-multifemale social system and usually live in groups of 20 to 200 individuals. In each group, dominance hierarchies exist.The dominant leader in the group is usually stockier in size and always has the priority to eat and or mate with other females. As many macaques are used to be fed by human and most feeders use plastic bags to carry the feed, some hungry macaques may rob plastic bags, whether it contains any food or not. It is therefore suggested not to carry plastic bags when observing macaques. Please remember that the ban on feeding monkeys (and other wild animals) under the Ordinance has been in force since 1999 and is applicable to Lion Rock, Kam Shan and Shing Mun Country Parks, part of Tai Mo Shan Country Park, Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve and some of the adjacent areas where wild monkeys can be found. Do not feed the monkeys when you are watching them!  br  br  strong Short-nosed Fruit Bats in Parks  strong   br  br Short-nosed Fruit Bats are one of the very common bat species in Hong Kong. They are widely distributed and can be found in many of the parks and gardens in urban areas. They modify the fronds of the Chinese Fan-palms and the Petticoat Palms to make their diurnal roosting tents. According to a survey on Short-nosed Fruit Bats by AFCD, they are commonly found on these two palm trees, in the height between 5 to 10 metres. About 6.5% of Chinese Fan-palms in urban areas contain roosts of this fruit bat. If you want to see the bats, you may locate a Chinese Fan-palm in a park and check the fronds to see whether they have any bite marks. If you find collapsing fronds with circular bite marks along the major veins, you may be able to see the bats under the collapsing “tent”. With the aid of a pair of binoculars, you can also identify the species by their ears and wing bones, which have white edges. In addition, the males are larger in size with an orange-tinted collar while the females are smaller with a yellowish brown collar. The immature individuals are often paler grey without any orange-tinted or yellowish brown collar. Furthermore, when roosting, a single dominant male Short-nosed Fruit Bat typically roosts either alone or in a harem of 2 to 20 reproductive females and their dependent young. In the daytime, a harem male can be further identified as comparatively more alert and active than the females, with the eyes opened and wings partially spread.  p

 p Besides the general hiking gear, such as sufficient food and drinks, compass and maps, there are some general tips for observing mammals or other wildlife that are useful to follow:  p 
 p align="justify" In addition, bats are very sensitive to human disturbance of their roosting sites. In winter, torpid or hibernating bats are extremely sensitive to the presence of human and will respond by an increase in activity. This may cost extra energy consumption and the bats may die from energy depletion before spring. Reproducing bats are also very sensitive to disturbance which can lead to young being dropped by their mothers or the bats being forced to move to other inferior sites. As bats often aggregate in colonies in caves such as water tunnels or abandoned mines, a single visit may affect a large number of bats already. Therefore, visits to roosting sites should be avoided.  p
