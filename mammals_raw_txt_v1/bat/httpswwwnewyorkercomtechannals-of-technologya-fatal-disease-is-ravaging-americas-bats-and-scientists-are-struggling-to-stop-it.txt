 p Since white-nose syndrome was first identified, just twelve years ago, it has spread to thirty-one states. The consequences—for bats, humans, and the U.S. economy—could be disastrous.  p 
 p Late  span data-page="page_1"   span last summer, the biologist Mark Gumbert began flying over the
farmlands of Iowa, looking for bats. As the animals foraged and moved
through the night, he followed from above, circling the rivers and
fields in his single-engine Cessna 172, trying his best not to lose the
signals from their transmitters. Over the past decade or so, Gumbert has
pioneered the study of bat migrations using radio telemetry, a method of
wildlife tracking  a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  www.newyorker.com tech elements remembering-the-craigheads-pioneers-of-wildlife-biology" typically
reserved  a  for caribou, moose, and other big game, which tend to travel at moderate
speeds. “A wolf running across the ground can move pretty quick, but
they’re not going to run all night,” Gumbert told me recently. A bat, on
the other hand, can be nearly impossible to trail on foot or by truck.
Gumbert and his team at Copperhead Environmental Consulting were the
first to observe an entire migration from the air, and they have since
conducted surveys in New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, West
Virginia, and elsewhere. But the project that brought Gumbert to Iowa
was unlike any he had undertaken before—tracking the  a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  www.newyorker.com magazine 2010 03 29 batless" northern
long-eared bat  a ,  em class="" Myotis septentrionalis  em , a species that is among those most
threatened by a dangerous fungal disease called white-nose syndrome.  p 
 p Since the syndrome was first identified, twelve years ago, it is
estimated to have killed more than six million bats nationwide, a number
that has undoubtedly risen since the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
issued its most recent official estimate, in 2012. As of September,
2017, the disease had spread to thirty-one states, some of which have
suffered ninety-per-cent declines in their bat populations; the crisis,
which began in New York, now extends as far west as Washington. “I think
most states would say it’s not a matter of if white nose is going to
show up but when,” Kelly Poole, the endangered-species coördinator for
the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, told me. The disease disrupts
the bats’ hibernation, causing them to wake up in winter, exert energy
looking for food, and, in time, starve. It is almost always fatal,
leaving  a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  www.newyorker.com tech elements the-fate-of-earth" caves full of
bones  a  in its
wake. Scientists have yet to find a cure or treatment. “I get a sense
that we may actually be witnessing the extinction of a couple of
species, at least regionally,” Gumbert said. “We may not lose a species
completely, but it wouldn’t surprise me if we did.”  p 
 p In a state such as Iowa, where the economy is based largely on
agriculture, white nose is particularly worrisome. According to a study
published in 2011 in the journal  em class="" Science  em , bats consume enough insects
to save U.S. farmers  a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  www.sciencedaily.com releases 2011 03 110331142212.htm" target="_blank" an estimated $22.9 billion a
year  a  in pest control and crop damage, a conclusion echoed by a follow-up
study in 2015. The findings suggest that a nationwide decline in bats
could result in higher food prices, owing to an uptick in pesticide use
and a reduction in crop yields. “That cost gets passed down to the
consumer, and you start seeing it at the grocery stores,” Piper Roby,
Copperhead’s research director, told me. She also noted that increased
pesticide use means more harmful chemicals in the ecosystem. “It’s just
this cascade effect if you remove a top-down predator, and you start to
see the effects of it years later,” she said.  p 
 p Gumbert’s efforts in Iowa, which began last August, were something of a
stopgap measure. The thinking was that, if he could track the northern
long-eared bats, often known simply as northerns, along their migration
routes, he would be able to identify where they ended up hibernating.
This, in turn, would allow state officials to protect the animals from
human encroachment, including wind-energy development, while they were
at their most vulnerable. As Poole, who is overseeing the project for
the D.N.R., put it, “We don’t know where the bats are hanging out.” The
fact that they are small and secretive complicates the process. Unlike
the bats of campy horror films, northerns tend not to form large
clusters in caves. If they did, Poole said, “then you’d have, like, one
cave to protect.” Instead, Gumbert told me, “They may actually be
roosting in the ground and in little crevices they can crawl into.” They
might be in groups of two or three, or they might be alone. He and his
team fitted thirty bats with transmitters in the course of the project,
seven of which were active in the field at the time. None, it seemed,
had ended up in the same winter refuge, known as a hibernaculum, or had
really migrated much at all; they were mostly making small jumps. “We’re
not exactly sure what they’re doing yet,” Roby said.  p 
 p To track those thirty bats required months of near-sleepless nights.
When conducting an aerial survey in the summer or fall, the team first
has to catch the bats one by one, by setting up nets in areas of known
bat activity. Once they catch one, they document its sex, weight, and
over-all health, then put a numbered band on one forearm and fit it with
a radio transmitter roughly the size and shape of a Tic Tac. Gumbert
takes off at dusk each evening. He searches for one bat at a time,
following the beeps from a receiver in the Cessna. Once he pinpoints one
bat’s location, he begins looking for the next; he will cycle through
the group again and again for the next four span data-page="page_final"   span  or five hours, waiting for
one to make a move. When that happens, Gumbert leaves the rest behind
and follows the bat however far it travels—in one case, more than two
hundred and twenty miles in the course of several days. It is mentally
exhausting work, he told me. “Not only am I listening to the beeps and
going through the frequencies of the bats that are out there; I’m also
looking for other aircraft,” Gumbert said. But he also finds flying at
night peaceful. In Iowa, as he tracked the bats, he picked out porch
lights scattered across the otherwise black fields of corn and soybeans.
“If there’s not a lot of haze, you can see the reflection of the moon on
the river below,” he said. Sometimes people will notice his plane
circling their property. “Then they get their big flashlight out and
they spotlight us, or they get their laser pointer,” he told me.  p 
 p Aside from the practical concerns of protecting the species, one of the
biggest challenges moving forward, Poole said, will be getting the
public to recognize the threat that white nose poses. It doesn’t help
the bats’ case, she added, that they’re not what most people would
consider  a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  www.newyorker.com magazine 2011 03 21 back-to-the-harbor" charismatic
megafauna  a .
When a conspicuous creature, such as a lion or
 a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  www.newyorker.com tech elements carnivores-next-door" wolf  a ,
teeters on extinction, folks tend to take notice. Last November, the
outcry over the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s plan to allow the import of
elephant trophies from two African countries was so severe that
 a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https:  twitter.com realDonaldTrump status 931685146415255552" target="_blank" President Trump had to get
involved  a .
Neither the northern long-eared bat, the little brown bat, the gray bat,
the Indiana bat, nor any of the other species now at risk from white
nose has inspired such widespread support, though their loss would no
doubt affect the country more severely than would the disappearance of
the elephant. But Roby told me that, even now, with white nose as
widespread as it is, researchers are already behind in simply trying to
understand the lives of bats—the northerns, in particular. “All of a
sudden, we’re starting to lose these populations, and we don’t know how
to help them because we don’t know what they need,” she said.  p 
 p By November 1st of last year, Gumbert and the
Copperhead team had concluded their aerial monitoring and were wrapping
up the last of their field work. They had confirmed the location of only
one hibernaculum. The bats had not migrated far—about twenty miles.
Ultimately, the project had led to more questions than it had answered,
Roby told me. Gumbert speculated that, for the time being, the most
effective way to help the bats, at least in Iowa, would be to protect
the forested areas along the major waterways where the animals are known
to forage and hibernate. Unlike most other endangered or threatened
species, he noted, northerns are generalists; they do not require
a specific habitat to thrive. Since Iowa isn’t short on bat habitat, what
northerns need most remains a mystery. Still, Gumbert said that he is
encouraged by signs that some species in the United States and abroad
may be developing an immunity to white nose. “I’m hopeful that bats
build up a resistance and they do survive,” he said. “I’m terrified to
think of my two-year-old growing up and there not being bats on the
landscape.”  p
