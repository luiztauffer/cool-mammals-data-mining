 p Australia’s commercial kangaroo industry began in 1959 and is considered one of the world’s best wild harvest operations. The industry is an important provider of jobs in regional and rural areas—industry representatives estimate that they employ around 4,000 people producing kangaroo products for both the domestic market and export.   p 
 p Kangaroo meat is sustainably sourced in accordance with quotas that are scientifically set and regularly monitored. It is estimated that around 3 % of Australia’s harvestable kangaroo population is used for meat production each year. Only 4 species are permitted for commercial harvesting for meat export (red kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, western grey kangaroo and common wallaroo).   p 
 p The Australian Government regulates the export activities of the kangaroo meat industry by registering processing facilities for export, overseeing production to ensure safety and issuing export certification for kangaroo meat products.   p 
 p The Australian Government is also involved in developing and maintaining access for kangaroo products worldwide— exporters now having access to more than 60 overseas markets.  p
