 p Kangaroos are common in many national parks and reserves and in some country regions of New South Wales. However they are not always around. During the hottest part of the day they usually rest in the shade.   p 
 p They are most easily spotted at dawn and dusk when they come out to feed. You may find them feeding in groups in open grassy areas adjacent to forests and woodland areas.  p 
 p A popular spot for reliably seeing kangaroos in the wild is at Depot Beach in  a href=" nationalparks parkHome.aspx?id=N0025" Murramarang National Park  a , 10 km north of Batemans Bay on the south coast. They graze around the campsite and grassy verges of the beach.  p 
 p Closer to Sydney, sometimes wallabies can be spotted in the late afternoon in The Basin, Pittwater. It is reached by ferry from Palm Beach (Pittwater side).   p 
 p In the  a href=" NationalParks parkHome.aspx?id=N0004" Blue Mountains National Park  a  , Euroka Clearing, just past the campsite near the Glenbrook entrance, is home to about 30 kangaroos between September and March.  p 
 p Around Coffs Harbour there are some good kangaroo sites. They include Safety Beach Golf Course (near Woolgoolga), Look At Me Now Headland (Emerald Beach), Hungry Head (near Urunga) and Dorrigo and Bellingen Valley national parks.  a href=" NationalParks parkHome.aspx?id=N0131"  br
