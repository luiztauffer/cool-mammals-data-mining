 p They have been described as the "world's happiest animal" and a photo of a Quokka snapping a selfie has proven why.  p 
 p Around the size of a cat, with the tail of a rat, the¬†nocturnal marsupials¬†can only be found on Australia's Rottnest Island and a handful of smaller islands around the coast of Western Australia.  p

 p So when Campbell Jones was on a bike ride around the Rottnest, and spotted a cute quokka, he stopped for a picture.  p

 p "They [the quokkas] just walk up to you," he said.  p 
 p "They are pretty friendly little things. We just went down to take photos of them and snagged [captured] a beauty, I suppose. It has been humbling that so many people wanted the photos."¬†  p 
 p Quokkas, famous for posing in selfies, are native to Rottnest Island where about 10,000 live a sheltered life free from predators or traffic.  p 
 p They are classified as a vulnerable species and have been almost completely wiped out on the mainland.  p 
 p Campbell isn't the first tourist to snap a selfie with a quokka. Allan Dixon,¬†who has¬†been described as the "real life Dr Dolittle", regularly posts photos with the¬†marsupial... along with other epic animal selfies.  p
