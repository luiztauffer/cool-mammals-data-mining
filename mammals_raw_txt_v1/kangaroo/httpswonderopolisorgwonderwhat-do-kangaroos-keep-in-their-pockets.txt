 p Today’s Wonder of the Day was inspired by HANNA.  em HANNA Wonders  em , “ strong WHAT DO KANGEROOS USE THEIR POUCH FOR   strong ” Thanks for WONDERing with us, HANNA!  p 
 p class="intro" What kind of  a href="http:  wonderopolis.org wonder does-music-influence-your-mood" target="_blank" music   a do kangaroos listen to? Hip- a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-hop" title="the act of hopping; jumping upward or forward (especially on one foot)" hop  span   a , of course! Actually, kangaroos don't really listen to music like we humans do. If they did own  a href="http:  wonderopolis.org wonder how-do-you-listen-to-music" target="_blank" MP3 players  a  and listen to music, though, we WONDER if they could like country, rock, or even classical music.  p 
 p We think kangaroos would be the perfect animals to take up the  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-hobby" title="an activity done regularly in one’s leisure time for pleasure" hobby  span   a  of listening to music. Why? They could put their MP3 players and  a href="http:  wonderopolis.org wonder how-do-noise-canceling-headphones-work" target="_blank" headphones   a into their pockets when they're not using them!  p 
 p Kangaroos are  a href="http:  wonderopolis.org wonder what-makes-an-animal-a-mammal" target="_blank" mammals   a that are part of a special group known as marsupials. Marsupials are mammals that have a special  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-pouch" title="a small or medium size container for holding or carrying things" pouch  span   a  used for carrying their babies. In addition to kangaroos, other marsupials include the  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-wombat" title="burrowing herbivorous Australian marsupial about the size of a badger" wombat  span   a , the  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-koala" title="sluggish tailless Australian arboreal marsupial with grey furry ears and coat; feeds on eucalyptus leaves and bark" koala  span   a , the  a href="http:  wonderopolis.org wonder do-you-ever-play-possum" target="_blank"   a  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-opossum" title="small furry Australian arboreal marsupials having long usually prehensile tails" opossum  span   a , and the  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-wallaby" title="any of various small or medium-sized kangaroos; often brightly colored" wallaby  span   a .  p 
 p Kangaroos and other marsupials have a special  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-pouch" title="a small or medium size container for holding or carrying things" pouch  span   a  — called a marsupium — for carrying their babies, because their young are particularly small when they're born. A baby kangaroo — called a  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-joey" title="the immature young of a marsupial, notably a junior kangaroo, but also a young wallaby or koala etc." joey  span   a  — is about the size of a  a href="https:  commons.wikimedia.org wiki File:Phaseoulus_lunatus.jpg# media File:Phaseoulus_lunatus.jpg" target="_blank" lima bean  a  when it's born!  p 
 p The mother's  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-pouch" title="a small or medium size container for holding or carrying things" pouch  span   a  provides a safe place for her babies to stay until they grow large enough to  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-survive" title="continue to live through hardship or adversity" survive  span   a  outside the  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-pouch" title="a small or medium size container for holding or carrying things" pouch  span   a  on their own. Since pouches are for babies to stay in, only  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-female" title="an animal that produces gametes (ova) that can be fertilized by male gametes (spermatozoa)" female  span   a  kangaroos have them.   p 
 p Male kangaroos who want pockets simply have to wear pants. Just kidding! Kangaroos don't wear pants, of course. Can you imagine what kangaroo pants would look like? They would have to be very flexible to  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-accommodate" title="make fit for, or change to suit a new purpose" accommodate  span   a  those long legs and all that jumping! Plus, where would the tail stick out?  p 
 p Because of their long feet, kangaroos can't walk normally. Instead, they use their big, powerful hind legs to  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-hop" title="the act of hopping; jumping upward or forward (especially on one foot)" hop  span   a  wherever they want to go. They also use their  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-muscular" title="having large, well-developed muscles" muscular  span   a  tails to help keep their  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-balance" title="a state of equilibrium" balance  span   a .  p 
 p The animals we call kangaroos are usually one of four  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-species" title="(biology) taxonomic group whose members can interbreed" species  span   a   a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-native" title="an original resident of a given place" native  span   a  to Australia: the red kangaroo, the eastern grey kangaroo, the western grey kangaroo, and the antilopine kangaroo. Fully-grown kangaroos are usually 5-6 feet tall and weigh 50-120 pounds, although large kangaroos can reach as much as 200 pounds.  p 
 p Kangaroos usually live and  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-travel" title="the act of going from one place to another" travel  span   a  in organized groups of 10 or more. These groups are called mobs, troops or courts. Male kangaroos are often called boomers, bucks, or jacks, while  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-female" title="an animal that produces gametes (ova) that can be fertilized by male gametes (spermatozoa)" female  span   a  kangaroos are often called does, flyers, or jills.  p 
 p So, if you're ever in Australia and you see a group of kangaroos that includes a father, mother, and a baby, you can say you saw a jack, a jill, and a  a href="#" class="word"  span data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="has-tip fnc-w-joey" title="the immature young of a marsupial, notably a junior kangaroo, but also a young wallaby or koala etc." joey  span   a  in a mob. And locals will probably know exactly what you're talking about!  p

 p I love kangaroos and just want to learn more about them. I just want to snuggle them and hide in their pockets! Quick question. Are there incidences where the male have pouches?   p 
 p Hi, Jade! Only female kangaroos have pouches.  We're glad to have you WONDERing with us!  p 
 p Hi there, just wondering if different species of kangaroos can mate eg. Red kangaroo and Eastrn grey .
Many thanks  p 
 p that was super weird.  p 
 p That's a good question, Bruno. Most of the time, animals can only successfully produce offspring if they mate with other members of their own species. However, there are certain circumstances when members of different species produce offspring. One example is when a horse and donkey produce a mule. Another example is the liger, which we explore in Wonder  a href="http:  wonderopolis.org wonder are-ligers-real" #1108.  a  However, we're not sure about kangaroos in particular. We encourage you to keep digging to discover the answer! :)  p 
 p Excuse me I don't know if you guys saw my comment but I actually asked if you guys knew how do they get the jelly belly bean boozle challange to get to smell that horrible  p

 p Hi, this is Wyatt from Mrs. Caplin's class. I was looking for a cool wonder and I found one.  At my zoo, we have a kangaroo exhibit where you can walk through and see them.  I had some extra time this morning, so I figured I would leave a comment. The video was adorable.  I love kangaroos, so I invited my mom to see the video (she kept interrupting).  So thanks thanks for the knowledge on kangaroos.  p
