 p Did you know that there are over  a href="http:  www.dfat.gov.au facts kangaroos.html" target="_blank" class="external" 60 different species  a  of kangaroo and their close relatives? How many kangaroos do you think live in  a href="  www.loc.gov law help guide nations australia.php?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" Australia  a  in total? 10,000? 1 million? 10 million? In fact, the population size of just the four most abundant kangaroo species has  a href="http:  theconversation.com its-raining-kangaroos-the-ups-and-downs-of-kangaroo-management-3976" target="_blank" class="external" fluctuated  a  between 15 million and  a href="http:  www.australianwildlife.net.au faq.html" target="_blank" class="external" 50 million  a  over the past 25 years, depending on seasonal conditions. That’s compared to Australia’s  a href="http:  www.abs.gov.au ausstats abs@.nsf 0 1647509ef7e25faaca2568a900154b63?opendocument" target="_blank" class="external" human population  a  of about 23.5 million, its  a href="http:  www.abs.gov.au ausstats abs@.nsf Lookup 7121.0main+features82012-2013" target="_blank" class="external" cattle population  a  of about 29.3 million, and its sheep population of about 75.5 million. The kangaroo population has in fact increased over the years as a result of land being cleared and water sources developed for farming purposes, while at the same time there has been a decrease in predators such as dingoes, leading to more habitats for the ‘roos to flourish in.  p 
 p Following on from our recent post on resources for  a href="  blogs.loc.gov law 2014 07 an-introduction-to-animal-law ?loclr=bloglaw" target="_blank" researching animal law  a , I thought I’d look specifically at Australian laws related to kangaroos. Some of these laws have come up again  a href="http:  www.austlii.edu.au au cases act ACAT 2014 35.html" target="_blank" class="external" in court  a  this year with animal protection groups trying to stop the sixth annual  a href="http:  www.tams.act.gov.au parks-recreation plants_and_animals urban_wildlife local_wildlife kangaroos 2013-kangaroo-control-program-questions-and-answers" target="_blank" class="external" conservation cull  a  of kangaroos in the  a href="http:  www.act.gov.au " target="_blank" class="external" Australian Capital Territory  a  (ACT). The seven-week long cull went ahead, albeit later than originally planned, and  a href="http:  www.abc.net.au news 2014-08-01 annual-kangaroo-cull-wraps-up-in-canberra 5640408" target="_blank" class="external" ended earlier this month  a  with more than 1,500 kangaroos killed across eight nature reserves, which was 95% of the  a href="http:  www.environment.act.gov.au __data assets pdf_file 0004 576715 Calculation_of_the_number_of_kangaroos_to_cull_.pdf" target="_blank" class="external" quota  a  that the ACT government had set. During this period, there were various protests as well as some  a href="http:  www.canberratimes.com.au act-news kangaroo-cull-vandalism-costs-act-taxpayers-thousands-20140718-zubw3.html" target="_blank" class="external" vandalism  a  of government property.  p 
 p  strong Recent Court Decisions  strong   p 
 p The  a href="http:  www.tams.act.gov.au parks-recreation plants_and_animals urban_wildlife local_wildlife kangaroos" target="_blank" class="external" ACT government  a  argues that culling is needed to  a href="http:  www.tams.act.gov.au parks-recreation plants_and_animals urban_wildlife local_wildlife kangaroos kangaroo_population_control_methods" target="_blank" class="external" manage the kangaroo population  a  in certain areas in order to  a href="http:  www.tams.act.gov.au parks-recreation plants_and_animals urban_wildlife local_wildlife kangaroos conservation-impacts-of-grazing-by-eastern-grey-kangaroos" target="_blank" class="external" protect native grassland  a  and the associated ecosystem that is affected by kangaroo grazing. In allowing for licenses to be issued in relation to the recent cull, the  a href="http:  www.austlii.edu.au au cases act ACAT 2014 35.html" target="_blank" class="external" court held  a  that  p 
 p The decision to issue each licence involves a balancing of competing ecological interests. On the one hand is the preservation of the existing populations of kangaroos in the relevant reserve area. On the other hand is the assessment of the reserves as containing endangered communities. The proposed culling does not threaten the eastern grey kangaroo as a species. However, allowing overgrazing and degradation of the environment may lead to significant impact on the endangered communities within the reserves.  p 
 p This ruling followed a similar challenge to a license granted by the ACT government to the Department of Defence in 2009 to  a href="http:  www.canberratimes.com.au act-news anger-at-defence-cull-of-14000-kangaroos-20130901-2sz23.html" target="_blank" class="external" undertake a cull  a  on land it used for a training facility. In that case the  a href="http:  www.austlii.edu.au au cases act ACAT 2009 17.html" target="_blank" class="external" court concluded  a  that  p 
 p There is compelling evidence that the number of Eastern Grey Kangaroos at the MTA [Majura Training Area] has been increasing rapidly in recent years to the point where it has exceeded the carrying capacity of the land and, as a consequence, has caused substantial damage to declared ecological communities and declared threatened species. In order to prevent further damage and to enable the degraded areas to recover, it is necessary to reduce the kangaroo population at the MTA substantially.  p 
 p The ACT is not the only state or territory of Australia that allows for kangaroos to be killed in quite large numbers. However,  a href="http:  www.tams.act.gov.au parks-recreation plants_and_animals urban_wildlife local_wildlife kangaroos Commercial_Harvesting" target="_blank" class="external" different from the ACT  a , the hunting in some other places may be undertaken for both conservation and  a href="http:  www.environment.gov.au resource commercial-kangaroo-harvesting-fact-sheet" target="_blank" class="external" commercial purposes  a . The federal government has approved management plans related to the sustainable harvesting of certain species of kangaroo (or wallabies in Tasmania) by licensed hunters in five states:  a href="http:  www.environment.nsw.gov.au wildlifemanagement KangarooManagementProgram.htm" target="_blank" class="external" New South Wales  a ,  a href="http:  www.qld.gov.au environment plants-animals wildlife-permits macropods " target="_blank" class="external" Queensland  a ,  a href="http:  www.environment.sa.gov.au managing-natural-resources Plants_Animals Permits_licences Native_animals_in_the_wild Kangaroo_Harvesting_Permits" target="_blank" class="external" South Australia  a ,  a href="http:  dpipwe.tas.gov.au wildlife-management management-of-wildlife managing-wildlife-browsing-grazing-losses permits-and-regulations" target="_blank" class="external" Tasmania  a , and  a href="http:  www.dpaw.wa.gov.au plants-and-animals animals 128-kangaroo-management-in-western-australia" target="_blank" class="external" Western Australia  a . Non-commercial culling of kangaroos is also permissible under the laws of the  a href="http:  www.lrm.nt.gov.au __data assets pdf_file 0010 11170 kangaroo_assessment.pdf" target="_blank" class="external" Northern Territory  a  and  a href="http:  www.depi.vic.gov.au environment-and-wildlife wildlife wildlife-management" target="_blank" class="external" Victoria  a . This past May the Victoria government  a href="http:  www.depi.vic.gov.au environment-and-wildlife wildlife wildlife-management kangaroo-trial" target="_blank" class="external" announced  a  a  a href="http:  www.theage.com.au victoria culled-kangaroos-to-be-harvested-in-victoria-for-pet-food-sale-20140318-350g8.html" target="_blank" class="external" two-year trial  a  that allows for meat from kangaroos killed pursuant to a wildlife management permit to be processed for pet food.  p 
 p  strong Legal Framework  strong   p 
 p The following is an overview of the  a href="https:  www.animallaw.info article overview-laws-governing-kangaroo-culling-australia" target="_blank" class="external" legal framework  a  applicable to the killing of kangaroos:  p 
 p I’ve provided links to the various instruments of different states and territories at the end of this post.  p 
 p  strong Trade in Kangaroo Products  strong   p 
 p class="wp-caption-text" Mob of kangaroos, Red Hill Reserve, Deakin, Canberra. Cazz’s Flickr photostream, June 2012. Used under Creative Commons License, https:  creativecommons.org licenses by 2.0 .  p 
 p Human consumption of kangaroo meat  a href="http:  www.environment.gov.au node 16678" target="_blank" class="external" became legal  a  in all Australian states and territories in 1993, having previously only been legal in South Australia (the other use for the meat is in pet food). However, kangaroo meat has been exported to Europe  a href="http:  www.dfat.gov.au facts kangaroos.html" target="_blank" class="external" since 1959  a , and it is now  a href="http:  www.bloomberg.com news 2014-03-05 kangaroo-on-the-menu-for-envoys-as-australia-seeks-export-boost.html" target="_blank" class="external" exported  a  to more than fifty-five countries. Apparently Russia became a  a href="http:  www.themoscowtimes.com business article kangaroo-meat-may-return-to-russian-tables 452576.html" target="_blank" class="external" significant buyer  a  of kangaroo meat from Australia, while the US and Asia are increasingly important. Russia  a href="http:  www.bloomberg.com apps news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.8xcwcTL.BM" target="_blank" class="external" banned  a  kangaroo meat imports in 2008 and 2009 due to bacterial contamination concerns,  a href="http:  www.abc.net.au news 2012-12-08 russia-eases-ban-on-kangaroo-meat-imports 4416522" target="_blank" class="external" easing  a  the ban in 2012, and it seems now that the country’s most recent  a href="http:  www.abc.net.au news 2014-08-08 russia-bans-agriculture-imports-australia-rural-reax 5657326" target="_blank" class="external" sanctions  a  on agricultural products from Australia could again  a href="http:  www.beefcentral.com live-export russian-ban-beef-cattle-and-roo-meat-exports-in-spotlight " target="_blank" class="external" impact  a  the trade.  p 
 p Kangaroo hides are also exported all over the world.  p 
 p In 2010, the year for which the most recent collated data is available from the federal government, around  a href="http:  www.environment.gov.au node 16774" target="_blank" class="external" 1.5 million kangaroos  a  were killed for commercial purposes across four states. The total quota for that year was over four million. The numbers were much less than five years earlier in 2005, when more than  a href="http:  www.environment.gov.au node 16769" class="external" 3 million kangaroos  a  were killed under commercial harvest quotas. The kangaroo industry organization estimates that the industry  a href="http:  www.kangaroo-industry.asn.au morinfo kangaroo_industry_background.pdf" target="_blank" class="external" currently generates  a  more than AU$270 million per year in income.  p 
 p  strong U.S. Import Ban  strong   p 
 p The commercial harvesting of kangaroos  a href="http:  ro.uow.edu.au cgi viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&amp;context=asj" target="_blank" class="external" constitutes  a  “the largest consumptive mammalian wildlife industry in the world.” However, as indicated by the above legal challenges, the practice, and the laws and regulations that allow for it, have certainly not been without controversy. In fact, in 1974, the United States  a href="http:  ecos.fws.gov docs federal_register fr39.pdf" target="_blank" banned  a  the import of kangaroo products over concerns about the kangaroo population, and the Australian government subsequently banned exports for a period in order to develop new regulations. The US import ban continued  a href="http:  www.nytimes.com 1981 05 05 science court-fight-over-importing-of-kangaroo-hide.html" target="_blank" class="external" until 1981  a , when government officials stated that “they had lifted the ban because the kangaroo population was now estimated at 32 million in Australia and the country had imposed hunting quotas.” The final rule allowing the continuation of the importation of kangaroo products into the U.S. was later published in 1983. However, this wasn’t the end of the debate.  p 
 p In 1984, the  a href="http:  www.fws.gov " target="_blank" US Fish and Wildlife Service  a  withdrew a proposed rule to remove three kangaroo species from the  a href="http:  ecos.fws.gov tess_public pub listedAnimals.jsp" target="_blank" list  a  of endangered and threatened wildlife (see  a href="http:  www.law.cornell.edu uscode text 16 chapter-35" target="_blank" class="external" 16 U.S.C. 1531-1544  a ) after being notified that a drought in Australia had affected the population. There were also various petitions by environmental groups in the late 1980s seeking the reinstatement of the import ban. US officials even visited Australia in 1990 to “investigate the population status of the three kangaroo species (survey methods, numbers, and trends) and the implementation of management programs.” Then, in 1995, the Service published a  a href="http:  www.gpo.gov fdsys pkg FR-1995-03-09 html 95-5823.htm" target="_blank" detailed final ruling  a  delisting the three species, stating that it was “the present sufficiency in kangaroo management in mainland Australia that causes the Service to find that the action to delist the three species of kangaroos is warranted.”  p 
 p The  a href="http:  www.csmonitor.com 1987 1112 akang.html" target="_blank" class="external" debate  a  during  a href="http:  www.aph.gov.au Parliamentary_Business Committees Senate Significant_Reports animalwelfarectte kangaroos index" target="_blank" class="external" the 1980s  a  also saw the  a href="http:  www.europarl.europa.eu portal en" target="_blank" class="external" European Parliament  a  imposing a partial ban on the import of kangaroo skins, and in the US a  a href="https:  beta.congress.gov search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22kangaroo%22%2C%22congress%22%3A%5B102%2C101%2C100%2C99%2C98%5D%7D" target="_blank" bill was introduced  a  seeking to impose stricter controls. Since that time, groups have  a href="http:  www.europarl.europa.eu meetdocs 2009_2014 documents peti dv peti20110315_sir1447-09_ peti20110315_sir1447-09_en.pdf" target="_blank" class="external" sought  a  import bans in some jurisdictions, and there have been  a href="http:  www.austlii.edu.au au cases cth AATA 2008 717.html" target="_blank" class="external" court  a   a href="http:  www.austlii.edu.au au cases cth AATA 2004 1383.html" target="_blank" class="external" cases  a  in Australia, in addition to those cited above,  a href="http:  www.austlii.edu.au au cases cth AATA 1986 151.html" target="_blank" class="external" challenging  a  decisions related to killing kangaroos.  p

 p Kangaroos are animals and have right to live according to SPCA, as it with human rights. I wouldn’t kill them. If they killed; then they need legal protection  p 
 p Thank you Kelly for making people outside Australia aware of the Kangaroo situation in this country. God knows the majority of Australians have no comprehension about what our Government sanctions and hides from them. br 
All the ‘Codes and Practices’ stated in the management plans for the states which allow this wholesale slaughter are only written on paper. The individual states have absolutely no way of enforcing or monitoring their laws because they don’t have enough manpower and even if they did they would not bother too much about Kangaroos because they are considered vermin. br 
The Kangaroo meat industry inflicts more pain and suffering on these incredible animals than was inflicted on the Jews in WW2. br 
We who try desperately to protect them are constantly between a rock and a hard place. If we do manage to find a way forward as with the Canberra issue, they move the goal posts and change the laws. br 
We are all volunteers and work without any income so taking the Governments to court is not an option and we need help. We need pressure to be brought on this practice from outside this country. If anyone can help us please, please do. br 
I am a member of Australian Wildlife Protection Council and we have a web site where anyone can read more about the plight of our Kangaroos.  p

 p B.  p 
 p I dearly love the kangaroo such iconic creature for Australia it angers me and saddens me that so many are killed the Australian government needs to tread carefully or they will destroy the animal which so many people come to see and what stands for Australia .  p 
 p dont kill kangaroos send them to other countries please  p 
 p Kangaroos are interesting animals. Why are we killing them? It isn’t right to take their lives away. It’s not right to take any animals lives away! We need to take stand and fight for animals! Fight for Animals!  p
