 p The  a class="" href="http:  www.vetstreet.com our-pet-experts baby-joey-hops-into-busch-gardens-tampa-bay" kangaroo  a  is one of Australia’s
iconic inhabitants. Gray kangaroos, like those pictured here, roam the

There are millions of
them in Australia, living in groups called mobs. Their babies are tiny at birth
and spend two months inside their moms' pouches before they emerge — and they
continue to take cover in there until they’re nearly a year old. br   p

 p The  a class="" href="http:  www.vetstreet.com our-pet-experts koala-baby-snuggles-with-mom" koala  a  is another one of Australia’s
most iconic animals. Contrary to popular belief, he's not a bear. Like the
kangaroo, this cuddly-looking creature is a marsupial. Female koalas carry their
joeys in their pouches for six months. Then the babies ride on their moms' backs or in their bellies until approximately their first birthdays.

animal group called monotremes, or egg-laying mammals. The group is found only in
Australia. Typically shy, they live in burrows that they  a target="_blank" title="Link: http:  www.australia.com en facts australias-animals.html" href="http:  www.australia.com en facts australias-animals.html" dig along
riverbanks  a . They each have a bill like a duck but a furry body like a
