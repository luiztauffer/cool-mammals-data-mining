The authority monitors the release and use of tags to ensure the harvest in any one area does not exceed the quota.
  p 
 p The complexity and detail of the controls in the management plans can be indicated by a brief examination of the  a href=" wiki New_South_Wales" title="New South Wales" NSW  a  plan.  It divides the State into 15 different zones, 14 in which commercial kangaroo harvesting is allowed and one comprising over one-third of the State in which no harvesting can take place.  The population is estimated in each individual zone and a harvest quota allocated to it.  An appropriate number of tags are then issued to the conservation authority managers in each zone, and these can only be obtained by kangaroo harvesters on two days of each month.  The harvester must use and submit reports for all tags issued before more can be obtained, and the issue of tags by zone is closely monitored.  As soon as the harvest in any one zone approaches the quota, it is closed to commercial activity for the rest of the year. sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-9" [9]  a   sup

 p To purchase the tags issued by the authorities, kangaroo harvesters must be licensed as such.  To do so, they must undergo training delivered by government-accredited agencies and approved by the Australian Tertiary and Further Education agency in the appropriate State.  This training covers the regulatory controls and compliance requirements, the  a href=" wiki Animal_welfare" title="Animal welfare" animal welfare  a  controls, and the hygiene controls to which each harvester must adhere.  They must then pass assessment in their knowledge and practices relating to these controls by two separate government departments.  This will include assessment of their competency with their firearms.

 p A project conducted by NSW Department of Agriculture, which employed extensive field study and highly sophisticated computer modeling techniques, has cast light on why kangaroo populations are so resilient to harvesting.  The project examined harvester activity and modeled it in response to terrain and prices paid for kangaroos harvested.  It demonstrated, in the areas investigated and at current prices, 20-40% of any one property will rarely be visited by a kangaroo harvester because the terrain is too rough or other limitations make it not economic to do so.  These areas then become  a href=" wiki Refugium_(population_biology)" title="Refugium (population biology)" ‘refugia’  a  areas, in which the resident kangaroo population is never harvested and from which the population expands to repopulate areas which are harvested. sup id="cite_ref-Murray-Darling_Basin_2004_11-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Murray-Darling_Basin_2004-11" [11]  a   sup
