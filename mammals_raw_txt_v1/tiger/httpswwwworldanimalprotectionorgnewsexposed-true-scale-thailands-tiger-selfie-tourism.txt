 p We've exposed a worrying trend in the horrific abuse suffered by captive tigers at the hands of Thailand’s tiger tourism industry, in a ground-breaking report on the issue.   p 
 p Our investigative report  em ‘ a href="http:  www.worldanimalprotection.org sites default files int_files tiger_selfies_exposed_a_portrait_of_thailands_tiger_entertainment_industry.pdf" Tiger selfies exposed: a portrait of Thailand’s tiger entertainment industry  a   em ’ comes in the wake of the  a href="http:  www.worldanimalprotection.org news thai-government-removes-five-tigers-abusive-tiger-temple-attraction" target="_blank" recent scandal at Tiger Temple  a , and ahead of International Tiger Day on Friday 29th July.  p 
 p  span style="line-height: 1.6;" The document reveals a fast-growing industry with  strong a third more   strong captive tigers in Thailand in just five years. In 2015, and at the beginning of 2016, there were  strong 830 tigers  strong  in the country's entertainment venues. This compares to strong  623   strong in 2010.  span   p 
 p  span style="line-height: 1.6;" Tiger entertainment venues are increasing in popularity. Tourists want an up-close-and-personal, ‘once in a life-time’ encounter with a wild tiger in captivity.  span   p

 p The main welfare concerns witnessed by our investigators at these venues were:  p 
 p Of all of the seventeen major tiger entertainment venues we investigated in Thailand, it was Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Pattaya that has the highest number of tigers in captivity, now that the tigers at the Tiger Temple have been confiscated. This venue is also the one where we observed the poorest conditions. This venue is also the one where our investigators observed the poorest conditions.  p 
 p  span style="line-height: 1.6;" Julie Middelkoop, head of our Wildlife – Not Entertainers campaign, said: “It is very worrying that at the time of our research there were 207 more tigers subjected to the misery of being entertainment for tourists than there were five years ago.  span   p 
 p  span style="line-height: 1.6;" “At Sriracha Tiger Zoo our investigator witnessed one tiger that was so thin the hips and ribs were visible.  span  span style="line-height: 1.6;" ”  span   p 
 p  span style="line-height: 1.6;" Together we can protect the tigers from the cruelty at these tiger entertainment venues. Which is why we're calling on:  span   p 
 p  span style="line-height: 1.6;" Julie Middelkoop added: “TripAdvisor, the largest travel site in the world, continues to promote and sell tickets to cruel wildlife attractions. Instead of selling tickets to some of the cruellest places like Sriracha Tiger Zoo they could be a part of the solution and help to end the suffering of tigers."  span   p
