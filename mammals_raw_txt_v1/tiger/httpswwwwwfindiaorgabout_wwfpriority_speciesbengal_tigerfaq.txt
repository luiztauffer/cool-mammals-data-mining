 p Tigers, like all other wild animals, tend to avoid people, but can attack in defense if they are taken by surprise or if they are with their young ones. Such incidences may sometimes lead to humans being mauled or killed by chance. Occasionally, an aged, sick or injured tiger that is unable to hunt its natural prey may also kill a human being and feed on the body. A few of such tigers may resort to killing human beings intermittently since man is an easy prey. But not all aged, sick or injured tigers become man-eaters.  br

A healthy cub may also acquire man-eating skills from his her mother. It is very difficult to state the exact reasons why a tiger turns man-eaters but the good thing is that such cases are extremely rare.  br
