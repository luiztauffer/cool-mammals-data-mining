 p BBC Earth and David Attenborough have teamed up once more for a new wildlife documentary series,  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  www.bbcearth.com dynasties " target="_blank" title="BBC Earth's Dynasties"  em Dynasties  em   a .  p 
 p Each of the five episodes in the series follows a specific species of animal, often the story of one animal during a challenging period in their lives.  p 
 p Epic family betrayals, devastating tragedies and complex politics combine to make  em Dynasties  em  a gripping  em Game of Thrones  em  of the animal kingdom.  p 
 p To celebrate this new wildlife series and its fantastic insight into the plot-twisting tales of these charismatic animal characters, we looked at each episode and the species featured in it, as well as how you can channel your own inner David Attenborough by seeing these incredible creatures in the wild in  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 3bb535e79a95418da4b47f16b6e20744" href=" about responsible-travel " target="_blank" title="Responsible Travel" a responsible and ethical way  a .  p 
 p Here are the heroes and heroines of  em Dynasties  em  and where you can see them in their natural habitats:  p 
 p The first episode of em  Dynasties  em  is a powerful political drama following alpha male David, the leader of a troop of 32 chimps in the forests of Senegal.  p 
 p David’s long reign of three years looked to come to an end as rivals started to eye up his crown, but twists and turns in his story will keep you guessing who will come out on top, right up until the end.  p 
 p Chimps are our closest relatives, as  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species chimpanzee" target="_blank" title="Chimpanzee Species - WWF" we share approximately 98% of our DNA them  a . There are an estimated 300,000 chimpanzees in the wild, which live in groups up to 150 strong. However, this number is steadily decreasing due to hunting and deforestation, making them an endangered species.  p 
 p These social animals live in forests and spend most of their time in the tree tops. When on the ground, chimps usually move on all fours, though they can walk on their back legs, like humans, if they wish.  p 
 p Highly intelligent creatures, chimps use tools such as sticks to fish termites out of mounds and use leaves as containers for drinking water.  p 
 p Chimps have the widest geographic distribution of any great ape and can be found across central Africa, from southern Senegal to western  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 54fd0e2bb0be4dafb523236191293fdb" href=" destinations uganda " target="_blank" title="Uganda" Uganda  a  and western  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 859a4cbb0545435abc88c4152955a030" href=" destinations tanzania " target="_blank" title="Tanzania" Tanzania  a .  p 
 p Although the chimps featured in this episode of  em Dynasties   em are located in Senegal, observation of these animals in the country is not as easy for travellers as it is in more developed safari destinations, such as Tanzania, Uganda and  a data-udi="umb:  document 9690db1947e142849d6a83ecddc12ec1" href=" destinations rwanda " title="Rwanda" Rwanda  a .  p 
 p Your best bet is probably the village of Ethiolo, followed by Mount Assirik and Parc National de Niokolo-Koba, depending on the season.  p 
 p Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania is the only park on the African continent specifically created for chimpanzees, while the country's Mahale Mountains are also known to be good for chimp-watching.  p 
 p You can also track both chimps and gorillas on  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document c0d7112d92034498a712cfac8ac7bcac" href=" holidays trekking-holidays " target="_blank" title="Trekking Holidays" trekking excursions  a  in Uganda's Kibale National Park and Rwanda's Nyungwe Forest National Park.  p 
 p Rather than following the story of an individual animal, as with the other episodes in the  em Dynasties  em  series, this episode looks at an entire colony of emperor penguins and how they must work together to survive harsh Antarctic winters.  p 
 p Thousands of male emperor penguins huddle together with their eggs to create a giant incubator and withstand monstrous blizzards.  p 
 p The episode follows the colony through the two-month incubation period, until the eggs hatch and the females return to help feed the new chicks.  p 
 p The largest of the 18 penguin species on the planet, emperor penguins can grow up to four feet tall and weigh up to 40 kilograms.  p 
 p Living in colonies of up to 20,000, emperors are the only species of penguin that are not territorial – these social creatures must huddle together in order to survive.  p 
 p Emperor penguins have a conservation status of “near threatened” as it is projected these animals will suffer a rapid decline in future generations due to the impacts of climate change.  p 
 p Emperor penguins are one of the trickiest of penguin species to be observed in their natural habitat.  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http:  www.antarctica.gov.au about-antarctica wildlife animals penguins emperor-penguins" target="_blank" title="Emperor Penguins - Antarctica" Endemic to Antarctica  a , the only place they can be seen by interested tourists and travellers is Snow Hill Island, in the Weddell Sea.  p 
 p You can see some of the Big White's wildlife on an intrepid  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document a18040a5f2b4458d868a9b03e481ee34" href=" destinations antarctica " target="_blank" title="Antarctica" Antarctica cruise  a , but if you don’t fancy a chilly trip down to the  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 35a747167e364aca8497e7a2b49ece55" href=" destinations antarctica antarctic-peninsula " target="_blank" title="Antarctic Peninsula" Antarctica Peninsula  a , it’s best to pick a different species of penguin to follow:  p 
 p Other species of penguins can be found in their natural habitats in many other places in the southern hemisphere, from the beach-loving African penguins found on the coasts on  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 34e6f6dacbc4481d875ecaac9ffa79bd" href=" destinations namibia " target="_blank" title="Namibia" Namibia  a  and  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document b45902f235cd4d259138eb0ac9233604" href=" destinations south-africa " target="_blank" title="South Africa" South Africa  a , to the little blue penguins, yellow-eyed penguins and Fiordland-crested penguins of  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 725e005ca3444ed98c0873fac4666296" href=" destinations new-zealand " target="_blank" title="New Zealand" New Zealand  a .  p 
 p When adult males abandon the Marsh Pride on  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document ad3ccf1d4327403283c328708f2cdb4a" href=" inspiration kenyas-masai-mara " target="_blank" title="Kenya's Masai Mara" Kenya’s Masai Mara  a , the future of the pride rests on the shoulders of almighty lioness, Charm.  p 
 p She must hunt around the clock to feed the pride’s cubs, as well as defend them from hyena, buffalo and other male lions, which aim to kill all cubs in a pride so that they can mate the females.  p 
 p Charm will stop at nothing to protect her cubs and her pride.  p 
 p Lions live in prides of related lionesses and their cubs, plus two or three adult males. The males rule the territory and the pride, providing protection, while lionesses do 90% of the pride’s hunting.  p 
 p Adults males can reach four feet high, seven feet long and weigh up to an incredible 250 kilograms.  p 
 p Lions were once found in many warm countries around the world, however there are now sadly only two confirmed populations left; a few hundred Asiatic lions in India and African lions in sub-Saharan Africa.  p 
 p African lions have no natural predators, however  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  www.wwf.org.uk wildlife african-lions" target="_blank" title="Lions - WWF" numbers have plummeted more than 40%  a  in the last three generations due to habitat loss, illegal wildlife trade and human conflict.  p 
 p The majority of wild African lions can be found in East and Southern Africa, in countries such as  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 859a4cbb0545435abc88c4152955a030" href=" destinations tanzania " target="_blank" title="Tanzania" Tanzania  a ,  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 5ef312e064e6494a8ab273d986613515" href=" destinations kenya " target="_blank" title="Kenya" Kenya  a , Botswana,  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document b45902f235cd4d259138eb0ac9233604" href=" destinations south-africa " target="_blank" title="South Africa" South Africa  a ,  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document f1b4298cdecb46da9849f54e75118ad0" href=" destinations zambia " target="_blank" title="Zambia" Zambia  a  and Zimbabwe.  p 
 p This particular episode of  em Dynasties  em  focuses on Charm and her pride in the  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 0fcc12d5094a43af87fc5bd81725c0ab" href=" destinations kenya masai-mara " target="_blank" title="Masai Mara" Masai Mara region in Kenya  a , known as one of the best wildlife destinations in the world and home to one of the highest concentrations of lions on the continent, combined with the neighbouring  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 13579ec11b8e4802b172179f40c20ff2" href=" destinations tanzania serengeti " target="_blank" title="Serengeti" Serengeti region in Tanzania  a .  p 
 p The story of another powerful female figure, this episode of  em Dynasties  em  centres around Blacktip, the leader of a pack of 30 painted wolves in the Mana Pools area of Zimbabwe.  p 
 p Due to the pack’s growing size, this alpha female must overcome challenges and take risks in order to gain more territory and feed her family.  p 
 p However, when that family turns on each other, who can she trust?  p 
 p Also known as African wild dogs, these creatures are confusingly neither wolves nor dogs, but a separate evolutionary canine group.  p 
 p Painted wolves are also one of the Africa’s most effective hunters, beating lions, cheetahs and leopards to the top spot with up to 80% of their hunts ending in a kill.  p 
 p However, a little less “beautiful” in comparison to their famous big cat neighbours, these animals have  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  paintedwolf.org " target="_blank" title="Painted Wolf Foundation" historically been treated as pests by humans  a , who have hunted them for taking down livestock.  p 
 p Only a hundred years ago there were around half a million painted wolves living in Africa, but today that number has diminished to an estimated 6,000, earning the African wild dog the conservation status of endangered.  p 
 p Due to depleted numbers, sightings of the elusive painted wolf are rare, even in their known habitats.  p 
 p However, if you’re eager to see one of Africa’s most persecuted species in the wild, then your best bets are Mana Pools in Zimbabwe (home to Blacktip and her family),  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 0d5f35a68fd94240bf2487583c18df30" href=" destinations kenya laikipia " target="_blank" title="Laikipia" Laikipia in Kenya  a , various regions of Botswana (especially in June), Luangwa Valley and  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 9cc9062aa0bb48fbb67a8469ff2dd4cf" href=" destinations zambia kafue-national-park " target="_blank" title="Kafue National Park" Kafue in Zambia  a  (green season only) and  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 50b59f6aee344659be53145443495a33" href=" destinations tanzania selous-reserve " target="_blank" title="Selous Reserve" the Selous in Tanzania  a  (between July and August).  p 
 p The finale of  em Dynasties  em  unravels the complex family dynamic of a group of tigers, namely the troubled relationship between experienced hunter tigress Raj Bhera and her older daughter (and now dangerous rival), Solo.  p 
 p With increasing threat to her smaller cubs and her territory, Raj Bhera must fight to defend her young family and her home from her own flesh and blood.  p 
 p The largest species of big cats in the world, adult tigers can weigh up to 363 kilograms. They are solitary hunters and unlike many feline species, love the water and are keen swimmers.  p 
 p Every tiger has a unique set of stripes and contrary to popular belief, white tigers are not a species of tiger, but carry a rare gene that has given them their colour.  p 
 p Tigers were once found throughout Asia, but hunting and habitat loss have reduced populations to  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  www.worldwildlife.org species tiger" target="_blank" title="Tigers - WWF" a fraction of the sizes they were only 100 years ago  a .  p 
 p Caspian, Bali and Javan tigers are now sadly extinct; though Bengal, South China, Indochinese, Sumatran and Siberian tigers can still be found today in depleting numbers totalling 3,200. There are more tigers held privately as pets than there are in the wild.  p 
 p It’s important to do your research before a trip or an excursion to see tigers to ensure that your visit is an ethical and responsible one – sadly, there are still many “tiger sanctuaries” and similar establishments mistreating and even drugging tigers, operating as tourist attractions.  p 
 p Of the 3,200 tigers left in the wild, around 2,500 are Bengal tigers, making this species the easiest to spot.  p

 p  em Dynasties  em  is yet another triumph of the partnership between BBC Earth and British national treasure, David Attenborough, following the successes of previous collaborations  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk programmes b006mywy" target="_blank" title="BBC Earth - Planet Earth" Planet Earth  a  and  a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https:  www.bbcearth.com shows blue-planet " target="_blank" title="BBC Earth - Blue Planet" Blue Planet  a  (discover  a rel="noopener noreferrer" data-udi="umb:  document 7d37366bea774f9b9ee6847f63783113" href=" inspiration blue-planet-filming-locations " target="_blank" title="Blue Planet Filming Locations" where to see the animals of Blue Planet  a  in our previous article).  p
