Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the north.  p

 p The tiger has adapted to a great variety of  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary environments" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="environments" environments  a , from the Siberian  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science taiga" class="md-crosslink" taiga  a , where nights can be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com plant mangrove" class="md-crosslink" mangrove  a  swamps of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Sundarbans" class="md-crosslink" Sundarbans  a , where the temperatures reach more than 40 °C (104 °F). Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and are at home in  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science habitat-biology" class="md-crosslink" habitats  a  ranging from dry  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science grassland" class="md-crosslink" grassland  a  to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science rainforest" class="md-crosslink" rainforest  a . Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science deciduous-forest" class="md-crosslink" deciduous  a  rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species. Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science heat" class="md-crosslink" heat  a  than other large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under stress it may climb trees.  p 
 p The tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large prey such as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal deer" class="md-crosslink" deer  a  ( a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal sambar" class="md-crosslink" sambar  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal chital" class="md-crosslink" chital  a , and swamp deer) and wild  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal pig-mammal-group" class="md-crosslink" pigs  a . A special liking for  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal porcupine" class="md-crosslink" porcupines  a , despite the danger of injury from their quills, is an exception. Healthy large  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal mammal" class="md-crosslink" mammals  a  are generally avoided, although there have been recorded instances of the tiger’s having attacked  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal elephant-mammal" class="md-crosslink" elephants  a  and adult  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal water-buffalo" class="md-crosslink autoxref" water buffalo  a .  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal cattle-livestock" class="md-crosslink" Cattle  a  are occasionally taken from human habitations, and some tigers can thrive on domestic  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal livestock" class="md-crosslink" livestock  a . After making a kill and consuming what it can, it makes a deliberate attempt to hide the carcass from  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal vulture" class="md-crosslink" vultures  a  and other scavengers so that another meal can be obtained. Tigers are not averse to commandeering a kill from other tigers or  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal leopard" class="md-crosslink" leopards  a , and they sometimes eat carrion. Skill in killing and obtaining prey is only partly instinctive, maternal training being essential for proficiency. For this reason, tigers raised in captivity would not fare well if released into the wild. As the  span id="ref1255259"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science top-carnivore" class="md-crosslink" top predator  a  throughout its range, the tiger plays a major role in controlling not only its prey  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science population-biology-and-anthropology" class="md-crosslink" population  a  but that of other predators such as the leopard,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal dhole" class="md-crosslink" dhole  a  (Asiatic wild dog), and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal clouded-leopard" class="md-crosslink" clouded leopard  a . No trait of the tiger has fascinated humans more than  span id="ref1248216"   span man eating. A number of reasons account for this—disability caused by age or injury, paucity of prey, acquisition of the habit from the mother, or defense of cubs or kill. With the reduction in the number of tigers, the occurrence of man-eating tigers has become rare except in the Sundarbans, the northeast Indian state of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Uttar-Pradesh" class="md-crosslink" Uttar Pradesh  a , and neighbouring  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Nepal" class="md-crosslink" Nepal  a  in and around Royal Chitwan National Park.  p 
 p As solitary animals, tigers (especially males) establish and maintain their own territories, the size and nature of which vary with the number and distribution of prey, the presence of other tigers in the area, the nature of the terrain, the availability of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science water" class="md-crosslink autoxref" water  a , and individual characteristics. Spacing between individuals and maintenance of territories are achieved through  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science vocalization" class="md-crosslink" vocalization  a , scrapings on the ground,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science claw" class="md-crosslink" claw  a  marking of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com plant tree" class="md-crosslink" trees  a , fecal deposits, scent deposited by the rubbing of facial glands, and spraying of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science urine" class="md-crosslink" urine  a  mixed with scent secreted from the anal glands. The solitary nature of the species also helps minimize territorial conflict. Nonetheless, confrontations do occur, sometimes resulting in injury and even death.  p 
 p The readiness of a tigress to  span id="ref828041"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science mating" class="md-crosslink" mate  a  is announced through vocalization and scent production. There is no fixed breeding season, though the preponderance of mating appears to occur in winter, with striped cubs being born after a gestation period of more than three months. The normal litter size is two to four, though up to seven cubs have been recorded. They are born blind, and, even when their eyes open, opacity prevents clear vision for six to eight weeks. There is thus a long period of weaning, tutelage, and training during which cub mortality is high, especially if food is scarce. During this time the offspring must endure long periods of absence by the mother while she is away hunting. Weaker cubs get less food because of the aggressiveness of their stronger siblings as food is less frequently made available. The cubs remain with the mother until about the second year, when they are nearly adult and are able to kill prey for themselves. Male cubs grow more quickly than females and tend to leave their mother earlier. Though cub infanticide (mainly by males) is known, it is not very unusual to find a male with a tigress and cubs, even sharing a kill. Such associations, however, do not last long. The tigress does not breed again until her cubs are independent. The average life span of a tiger in the wild is about 11 years.  p 
 p Next to the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal elephant-mammal" class="md-crosslink autoxref" elephant  a  and the lion, no wild  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal animal" class="md-crosslink autoxref" animal  a  is so frequently portrayed in  span id="ref1248217"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Asia" class="md-crosslink" Asian  a  art and lore. The persistent practices of using tiger parts as talismans, tonics, or medicine, despite all scientific evidence contrary to their  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary efficacy" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="efficacy" efficacy  a , are  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary manifestations" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="manifestations" manifestations  a  of beliefs that emanate from the aura of the tiger and the awe that it has inspired for millennia. Certain animist  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary communities" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="communities" communities  a  still worship the tiger. Every 12th year of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science Chinese-calendar" class="md-crosslink" Chinese calendar  a  is the year of the tiger, and children born in it are considered especially lucky and powerful. In Hindu mythology the tiger is the  span id="ref1255527"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic vahana" class="md-crosslink"  em vahana  em   a  (“vehicle”) of the goddess  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic Durga" class="md-crosslink" Durga  a . Tigers are represented on seals from the ancient  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic Indus-civilization" class="md-crosslink" Indus civilization  a . The greatest of the  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic Gupta-dynasty" class="md-crosslink" Gupta  a  emperors of ancient India,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com biography Samudra-Gupta" class="md-crosslink" Samudra  a , minted special gold coins depicting him slaying tigers.  a href="https:  www.britannica.com biography Tippu-Sultan" class="md-crosslink" Tippu Sultan  a  even vented his frustration at his inability to defeat the British by ordering a special life-size toy, replete with sound, of a tiger mauling a British soldier.  p 
 p At the beginning of the 20th century, the world’s tiger population was estimated at 100,000, even though they had been hunted for at least a thousand years. Tigers were prized as trophies and as a source of skins for expensive coats. They were also killed on the grounds that they posed a danger to humans. As the century drew to a close, only 5,000 to 7,500 were left in the wild, and captive tigers may now outnumber wild ones. Since then, the world’s tiger population has declined to about 3,200 animals. The  span id="ref981145"   span South China tiger ( em P. tigris amoyensis  em ) is the most endangered, with only a few dozen animals remaining. The  span id="ref1101346"   span Malayan subspecies ( em P. tigris jacksoni  em ), which was determined to be genetically distinct from the Indo-Chinese subspecies ( em P. tigris corbetti  em ) in 2004, is composed of perhaps 500 individuals. The Siberian and Sumatran subspecies number less than 500 each, and the Indo-Chinese population is estimated at less than 300. Three subspecies have gone  span id="ref828042"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science extinction-biology" class="md-crosslink" extinct  a  within the past century: the  span id="ref981146"   span Caspian ( em P. tigris virgata  em ) of central Asia, the  span id="ref981147"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal Javan-tiger" class="md-crosslink" Javan  a  ( em P. tigris sondaica  em ), and the  span id="ref981148"   span Bali ( em P. tigris balica  em ). Because the tiger is so closely related to the  span id="ref828043"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal lion" class="md-crosslink" lion  a , they can be crossbred in captivity. The offspring of such matings are called  span id="ref1248204"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal tigon" class="md-crosslink" tigons  a  when the male (sire) is a tiger and  span id="ref1248205"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal liger" class="md-crosslink" ligers  a  when the sire is a lion.  p 
 p Serious concern for the declining number of tigers was expressed during the latter half of the 20th century, and gradually all countries in the tiger’s range took measures to protect the animal, but with varying degrees of success. The tiger is now legally protected throughout its range, but law enforcement is not universally effective.  span id="ref981149"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place India" class="md-crosslink" India  a , which accounts for half the world’s tiger population, declared it the national animal and launched  span id="ref828044"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic Project-Tiger" class="md-crosslink" Project Tiger  a  in 1973, a successful program under which selected tiger reserves received special conservation efforts and status. Nepal,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Malaysia" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Malaysia  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Indonesia" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Indonesia  a  have set up a  span id="ref1248206"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Southeast-Asia" class="md-crosslink" string  a  of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science national-park" class="md-crosslink" national parks  a  and sanctuaries where the animal is effectively protected;  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Thailand" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Thailand  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Cambodia" class="md-crosslink autoxref" Cambodia  a , and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Vietnam" class="md-crosslink" Vietnam  a  are pursuing the same course.  span id="ref1248207"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place China" class="md-crosslink" China  a , the only country with three subspecies of tigers, is also giving special attention to  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science conservation-ecology" class="md-crosslink" conservation  a . In  span id="ref1248208"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com place Russia" class="md-crosslink" Russia  a , where  span id="ref828048"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic poaching-law" class="md-crosslink" poaching  a  seriously endangered the Siberian tiger, concentrated effort and effective patrolling have resulted in a revival of the subspecies.  p 
 p In the 1970s tiger  a href="https:  www.britannica.com sports hunting-sport" class="md-crosslink" hunting  a  for sport was banned in most countries where tigers lived, and the  span id="ref1248214"   span trade in tiger skins was outlawed. Nevertheless, tiger skins are still highly valued for display and for worship, as are claws, teeth, and  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science clavicle" class="md-crosslink" clavicles  a  for  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic talisman-charm" class="md-crosslink" talismans  a .

These products are presumed to be useful in the treatment of  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science rheumatism" class="md-crosslink" rheumatism  a ,  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal rat" class="md-crosslink" rat  a  bites, and various other  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science disease" class="md-crosslink" diseases  a , for the restoration of energy, and as  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic aphrodisiac" class="md-crosslink" aphrodisiacs  a ; whiskers are believed to cause intestinal  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science ulcer" class="md-crosslink" ulcers  a  in one’s enemies.  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic poaching-law" class="md-crosslink" Poaching  a  and the underground trade in tiger parts continue despite seizures and destruction of the confiscated parts.  p 
 p Although poaching has been responsible for keeping the number of tigers low during the past three decades, wild tigers would still be threatened even if all poaching ceased. In countries such as India, the needs of rapidly growing human populations over the last two centuries have reduced both the quantity and the quality of  span id="ref1248209"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com science habitat-loss" class="md-crosslink" habitat  a . Forests and grasslands so favoured by the tiger are cleared for  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic agriculture" class="md-crosslink" agriculture  a . Reduction in prey populations results in greater dependence on  a href="https:  www.britannica.com animal livestock" class="md-crosslink" livestock  a  and the consequent  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary retribution" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="retribution" retribution  a  from man. Fortunately, the status of the tiger has aroused widespread  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary empathy" class="md-dictionary-link" data-term="empathy" empathy  a , and its cause has received substantial international support. The  span id="ref981150"   span  a href="https:  www.britannica.com topic WWF" class="md-crosslink" World Wide Fund for Nature  a  has been a pioneer and the largest contributor, along with corporate donors and nongovernmental organizations.
