 p  br According to Hanan, this means a surplus orange tigers and imperfect white tigers born in the process are often unwanted and disposed of.   p 
 p Deliberate inbreeding has maintained the animals’ recessive coloration, but it also has led to a wide range of health problems. This inbreeding has caused  a href="http:  www.wildcatsanctuary.org the-truth-about-white-tigers " target="_blank" many genetic problems  a  with tigers such as cleft palates, scoliosis of the spine, mental impairments and crossed eyes.   p 
 p "When white tigers are showcased, it encourages the irresponsible inbreeding needed to supply this abusive industry. This white tiger mania is also a big reason why we have more orange tigers in cages in the U.S. today than tigers left roaming in the wild," Hanan said.  p 
 p Odds are against white tigers being able to survive infancy to adulthood, especially in the wild; their white coat does not work well as camouflage for a predator that has to hunt to survive.  p
