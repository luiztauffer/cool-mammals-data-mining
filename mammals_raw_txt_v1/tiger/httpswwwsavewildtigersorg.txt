          Tigers in the wild are killed illegally to fuel the demand for
          tiger products such as tiger skins and tiger bone wine. A century ago,
          there were over 150,000 wild tigers roaming the planet. Now, due to
          human greed and carelessness, only 3,800 tigers are left in the wild.
          It’s a number that continues to fall.
          p 
 p 
          Illegal poaching is the greatest threat to those few tigers who have managed
          to survive in the wild. An increasingly sophisticated global network of illegal
          wildlife trafficking is exploiting the vulnerability of endangered animals
          such as rhinos, elephants, bears, and tigers, in order to satisfy demand.
          As is the case for other endangered animal products such as rhino horn and
          elephant ivory, demand for tiger skins, parts &amp; derivatives drives the illegal
          slaughter and trade in these products. People are poaching tigers to sell their skin,
          claws, and products like tiger bone wine on the black market. Wild Tigers are
          being driven to the brink of extinction, largely because people want luxurious
          home décor, prestigious gifts, and products as trivial as tiger bone wine.
          p 
 p 
          It’s now time to put Wild Tigers back at the top of the agenda, to stop tiger poaching,
          put an end to tiger trade, and ensure their survival.
          p 
 p 
          Together, we have a responsibility to save the world’s wild tigers.

          This high impact film is the first step in Save Wild Tigers’ global tiger
          conservation campaign to raise awareness and reduce demand for illegal
          tiger products. Stop the demand, stop the poaching.

 p  span style="color:#ffcc66;"  strong 137 TIGERS REMOVED FROM CORRUPT "TIGER TEMPLE" IN THAILAND  strong   span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" The Tiger Temple, a popular tourist attraction in Kanchanaburi province, west of Bangkok, has been exposed as a tourist trap and front for illegal wildlife trade.   span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" Following mounting allegations of animal abuse and illicit wildlife trafficking from conservation and animal rights organisations, Thai police and wildlife officials raided the Buddhist Tiger Temple under a court order on Monday 30th May 2016.   span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" The Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation undertook an operation to remove all 137 living tigers to state-owned sanctuaries, Pa Khao Son and Khao Prathap Chang in Ratchaburi. Local veterinarians and wildlife conservation organisations assisted in the relocation.   span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" Suspicions were confirmed when, on Thursday 2nd June, three Buddhist monks were charged after they were caught trying to smuggle tiger skins and charms made from tiger parts away from the temple.   span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" The gruesome discovery of 40 dead tiger cubs, kept frozen in jars, further compounded speculation that illicit tiger products such as tiger bone wine were being made at the Tiger Temple.   span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" The Tiger Temple, which for many years claimed to be a sanctuary for the critically endangered species, tacitly endorsed by the tourism industry, has finally been shut down. While this is a victory for conservationists, it raises serious questions about other so-called tiger sanctuaries and farms that have not been subject to the same scrutiny by the authorities.  span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" Save Wild Tigers founder Simon Clinton talked to BBC World News on 15 April 2016 about the pros and cons of translocating wild tigers to former tiger range countries. Will plans to introduce Bengal tigers from India into Cambodia and Amur tigers from the Russian far east into Kazakhstan be successful?  Simon discusses tiger conservation priorities and contemplates the best use of precious resources.  span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" The BBC story followed the conclusion of the 3rd Asian Ministerial Conference on Tigers in New Delhi (12-14 April 2016), where Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that "conservation of the tiger is not a choice, it is an imperative."  span   p 
 p  span style="color:#ffffff;" Following the conference, Save Wild Tigers, along with 22 other non-governmental organisations, signed a post-meeting statement urging top level action from governments, to:  span   p

 p  span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 102); font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;" INCREASE IN GLOBAL WILD TIGER NUMBERS  span   p 
 p For the first time in recent history, the estimated number of tigers in the wild has increased, giving hope to conservationists across the globe. The global wild tiger population has been steadily declining from 150,000 in 1900 due to poaching, habitat loss and development across tiger-range countries. In 2010, the global wild tiger estimate was reported at an all-time low of 3,200. There are now an estimated 3,890 wild tigers across 12 countries from Russia to Indonesia.  p 
 p This positive news comes as the 3 sup rd  sup  Asian Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation convenes in New Delhi today. The increase may be largely attributed to committed efforts since the Global Tiger Summit in 2010 by governments in India, Russia, Nepal, and Bhutan.  p 
 p Overall, however, the status of wild Tigers is still CRITCAL. Whilst wild tiger populations in India are on the rise, numbers are dwindling to below 10 in China, Vietnam, and Lao PDR, and the situation in Malaysian and Indonesia is acute. Just last week Cambodia declared that its tiger population is now functionally extinct.    p 
 p The new estimate must be accepted with caution as many of the numbers are statistical means or estimates based on the best available knowledge. Actual populations, both today and in 2010, may be higher or lower and some of the increase may be attributed to improved survey methods.  p 
 p Nevertheless, the upward trend is an inspiring step toward the 2022 goal of increasing global wild tiger numbers to more than 6,000. Currently the biggest threat to wild tigers is poaching to fuel demand for tiger products, parts, and derivatives. If the governments of tiger range countries will adopt a commitment to zero poaching in New Delhi this week, as called for by Save Wild Tigers along with 22 other NGOs, wild tiger populations will have a real chance of fighting back.   p
