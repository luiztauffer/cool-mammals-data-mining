 p data-reactid="142"  !-- react-text: 143 -- The camps and guides below specialize in lion observation while also offering great general game viewing. Be aware that you may have very different types of lion sightings depending on the terrain and your safari type (walking, game drives, canoeing, etc). Pride behavior shifts from territory to territory depending on the group's size, seasonal game movement, rivalries between male lions, and pressure from other predators such as hyenas. As a general rule for safari planning, check the blog of safari lodges you are considering for reports of lion pride activity. Also see if off-road driving and night drives are possible to increase your chances of following lions hunting. (During daylight hours you are more likely to see the big cats sleeping as they digest prey killed the previous evening.) And always ask your  !--  react-text --  a href="http:  www.cntraveler.com travel-tips travel-specialists 2013 africa-indian-ocean" data-reactid="144" travel specialist  a  !-- react-text: 145 --  to request that a senior guide escort your game drives and walks, since an experienced lodge staffer will know the environs and the ranging animal populations far better than a new arrival. !--  react-text --   p 
 p In Tanzania, at Lake Manyara, Tarangire National Park, and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, lions are often sighted climbing acacia trees (a behavior also seen in Uganda's  a href="http:  www.queenelizabethnationalpark.com " Queen Elizabeth National Park  a ). Lions normally rest on the ground, but it's believed prides living in areas with lots of biting tsetse flies have learned to seek refuge in trees.  p

According to  !--  react-text --  a href="http:  www.cntraveler.com travel-tips travel-specialists mark-nolting" data-reactid="157" Mark Nolting  a  !-- react-text: 158 -- , one of Condé Nast Traveler's recommended safari specialists, a private vehicle and top guide are key, "and the overriding variable is that the guide must have unlimited mileage and no restrictions from the safari company he is working with as to how far he can drive in a day. This allows him to follow his nose and reports from fellow guides to maximize lion sightings." Nolting's Africa Adventure Company pays private school fees for the kids of guides who consistently deliver great experiences as an extra incentive to put maximum energy and creativity into finding the species that clients hope to see. Recently, a group of Nolting's clients chalked up more than 150 lion sightings, including a huge male that stalked and brought down a hyena. !--  react-text --   p

 p Don't expect to see all the action depicted in wildlife documentaries. Lions spend most of their time sleeping. A good guide will explain the nuances of lion society and behavior and know how to maximize your chances of witnessing a stalk or hunt.  p 
 p data-reactid="197" Within Botswana's Okavango Delta, GPC's Duba Plains has exclusive access to a unique lion habitat: a permanent island where a large buffalo herd, trapped by surrounding water, engages in an epic battle with resident lions who have become buffalo hunting specialists; following the buffalo herd during a three-day stay allows many guests to observe a full hunting cycle. "A guide at Duba Plains will know more about lions in a year than any guide in the world. It's lion boot camp," says Dereck Joubert. Guests particularly praise guide James Pisetu for his awareness of Duba's ecosystem. Lion prides living in proximity often behave very differently because of subtle changes from territory to territory, so it's worth dividing your Okavango safari between several locations. At Selinda Explorer's Camp, Kane Motswana is a San Bushman who applies his traditional tracking skills to a smart, unique almost spiritual style to guiding around a permanent channel linking the Okavango Delta with the Linyanti and Kwando water systems, where lions are sometimes seen preying on hippos.  p

The park lion population stands at about 120, divided between four prides that hang out near the Zambezi river, and four more in the remote Chitake Springs sector. Depending on the situation (lions may be more aggressive while they are feeding or tending young cubs), guests approach on foot to about 50 yards then crouch down and approach in tight formation to about 20 yards. "We'll sit down and quietly observe, sometimes getting even closer by scooting forward together on our backsides," says Murray. "Before setting out we go over safety procedures, such as staying in a group behind me, and never turning your back or running from a lion." The walking safaris operate from May until the start of the November rainy season. Prime time is August through September, before dry season temperatures become too hot, and to catch both lions and the wild dog denning season. Murray says the local lions are generalists as hunters but have become especially adept at taking down impala which live in the thousands around Mana Pools. !--  react-text --   p

Such operations may claim to breed lions for education and "conservation," but the reality is that when cubs grow too large to be handled safely, they are often sold to companies that raise domestically bred African game for the canned hunting industry. In canned hunting, hand-reared animals with little fear of humans are released into a fenced area for hunters to track down and shoot in a short period of time. A law against the canned hunting of predators was repealed in 2010, and more than 160 ranches hold a captive population of about 3,500 lions—larger than South Africa's wild lion population. Hunters pay up to $38,000 for a captive-bred male lion trophy, and farmers are also supplying growing demand from Asia for lion bones for traditional medicine. !--  react-text --   p
