Just a few days before news of the Trump-era lion imports became public, a leaked letter from the South Africa Department of Environmental Affairs revealed that it had  a href="https:  www.independent.co.uk news world africa lions-bones-south-africa-tigers-ramaphosa-exports-poaching-canned-hunting-traditional-chinese-a8459216.html" style="box-sizing:inherit; transition:all 250ms ease-in-out; background-repeat:initial initial; background-position-x:0px; background-position-y:0px" target="_blank" nearly doubled the amount of lion bones and skeletons it would allow to be exported from the country  a , from 800 a year to 1,500.  span   span   span   span   span   span   p

The heads and skins from these caged hunts become trophies, but the rest of the bodies—and many of the other lion carcasses from the factory farms—are shipped to Asia, where the bones are ground down to be used as “medicine” and as a component in wine.

Many experts say the increase in the lion-bone trade is a response to the decline in wild tiger populations in Asia. Tigers are also poached for “medicinal” products, although those big cats have become so rare in the wild—an estimated  a href="https:  blogs.scientificamerican.com extinction-countdown tigers-at-risk " style="box-sizing:inherit; transition:all 250ms ease-in-out; background-repeat:initial initial; background-position-x:0px; background-position-y:0px" target="_blank" 3,900 animals spread across a dozen countries  a —that the industry has been forced to turn to other felines to feed its fortunes.  span   span   span   span   span   span   p

About half of those cats were exported to Vietnam and Thailand, hubs of tiger-product smuggling activity.  span   span   span   span   span   span   p

The two organizations used their report to call for eliminating all lion exports from South Africa, restricting the breeding of lions and other big cats, and investigating the finances of breeders.  span   span   span   span   span   span   p

Add legal trophy hunting and poaching inspired by the legal bone trade into the mix and that timeline may become accelerated—and lions throughout Africa could pay the price.  span   span   span   span   span   span   p
