But is the recent barrage of attacks on trophy hunting, and the  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.telegraph.co.uk news worldnews africaandindianocean zimbabwe 11767119 Cecil-the-lions-killer-revealed-as-American-dentist.html" US dentist who killed Cecil  a , justified?  p 
 p Let’s be clear: Cecil was killed illegally, which we don’t condone. The landowner who allowed the hunt on his reserve without the necessary permit should face the justice system. But this one bad apple should not tarnish an entire industry.  p 
 p Legally hunting lions in Zimbabwe is highly regulated: it requires various permits and licenses from the client, professional hunter and hunting reserve owner. National quotas aim to ensure sustainable off-take of the species and, in western Zimbabwe, lions are only killed once they have reached  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.panthera.org sites default files PFunston_PLOS_Biology_1.13.pdf" a certain age  a  to make sure they’ve had the chance to pass their genes on. As a result, lion populations in Zimbabwe  a target="_blank" href="http:  ec.europa.eu environment cites pdf reports SRG%2068_6%20Review%20of%20trophy%20hunting%20in%20selected%20species%20_public_.pdf" are either stable or increasing  a .  p 
 p So if hunts are conducted following these rules, can trophy hunting really help conserve lions? Some argue that even if this were the case, the practice still shouldn’t be allowed because it involves killing a charismatic and threatened  a target="_blank" href="https:  www.thedodo.com killing-for-fun-how-trophy-hun-611573902.html" animal for fun  a .  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.ifaw.org sites default files Ecolarge-2013-200m-question.pdf" Opponents  a  suggest that non-lethal alternatives such as photographic tourism should be the main way in which conservation is funded. But there are a number of problems with this argument.  p

It should also be noted that the potential for nature tourism is not equally distributed, with the industry often focused only around a few locations. This leaves other regions without access to tourism revenue.

 p Zimbabwe has a tradition of using trophy hunting to promote wildlife conservation. Through the CAMPFIRE programme, which ran from 1989 to 2001, more than US$20m was given to participating communities,  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in files Ecological%20Economics%202008.pdf" 89% of which came from sports hunting  a .

 p Zimbabwean trophy hunting generates  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.wildlife-baldus.com download 8_.pdf" roughly US$16m of revenue annually  a . While it has been rightly pointed out that only 3% of this goes towards local communities, the ethical implications of removing this money without a clear alternative need to be examined.  p 
 p The economic impact of trophy hunting in comparison to tourism as a whole may not be huge, but what is the alternative if it is made illegal? Zambia  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.reuters.com article 2013 01 10 uk-zambia-hunting-ban-idUSLNE90900T20130110" banned  a  trophy hunting of big cats in 2013, only to  a target="_blank" href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk news world-africa-32815508" reverse  a  it earlier this year because the government needed the money to fund conservation.  p 
 p Conservation costs money – so does the damage done by lions killing livestock. It is not clear whether photographic tourism alone could cover these financial burdens.  p
