 p It’s easy to think of a safari park as a place where a bit of Africa or Asia has been conveniently dropped into your section of the United States. For the most part, this is true – a traditional wild animal park often does contain exotic animals and terrain that recreates a savannah, a desert, or a jungle. But some of the animal parks on this year’s top ten list feature the flora and fauna of their region, giving it the importance and respect it deserves.  p 
 p Still, safari parks are more than just lions and tigers and the occasional bear. They are also a great way to help kids learn about the environment, from the remarkable diversity in the animal kingdom to the workings of their own local ecosystem. So, without further ado, here are the ten parks we’ve chosen as the best places to go on safari without leaving the country.  p 
 p id="caption-attachment-9682" class="wp-caption-text" Pine Mountain Wild Animal Safari  p 
 p  strong Pine Mountain, GA  strong   p 
 p One of two sister safari parks, the Pine Mountain Wild Animal Safari Park is home to a variety of animals, from American bison to African giraffes. In fact, this 250-acre expanse contains more than 120 species of animals, including parrots, peacocks, lemurs, lizards, wolves, and wallabies. You can rent a bus or van for the 3.5 mile tour, or you can use your own vehicle. And there’s also a stroll-friendly section, where kids can hand-feed some of the park’s smaller, tamer residents.  p

 p Approximately midway between Flagstaff and Phoenix, the Out of Africa Wildlife Park offers a mix of entertaining and informative shows, a bush safari, and a wildlife preserve. If the kids want to see a tiger swim or an armadillo named Tucker strut his stuff, this is the place to go. There’s even the chance to (safely) feed a tiger. The 40-minute bus ride gives you an up-close view of zebras, antelopes, and other African animals. For the more adventurous group, there’s also a 2.5 hour zipline tour.  p

The Park’s residents include bison, elk, deer, wolves, pelicans, black bears, cranes, and eagles. There’s a picnic area for groups, and a hands-on area for kids to feed goats, chickens, and other farmyard critters.  p

Guests can go on safari, trek through ‘jungles’, explore recreated forests, or ride the Wildlife Express train. And the younger crowd will probably want to see DinoLand USA.  p

Add in the chance of ice cream at the end, and it’s no wonder why safari parks are favorite field trips.  p
