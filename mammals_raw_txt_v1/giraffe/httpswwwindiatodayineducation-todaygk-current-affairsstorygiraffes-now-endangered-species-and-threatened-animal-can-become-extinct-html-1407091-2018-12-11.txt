 p Two subspecies of giraffes were recently added to the list of "critically endangered" species for the first time ever, as per athelatest report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which administers the world's official endangered species list.  p 
 p The next slots after 'vulnerable' are 'endangered', 'critically endangered', 'extinct in the wild', and 'extinct'. Thus, if we do nothing about it, giraffes could become extinct in the wild in the medium-term future.  p 
 p There are nine subspecies of giraffes. Five of them are declining in numbers, two are improving, and one is stable, reports the New York Times.  p 
 p Another subspecies living in the Horn of Africa -- called the reticulated giraffe - was listed as "endangered".  p

 p Even though the Kordofan giraffe and the Nubian giraffe are now critically endangered, the West African and the Rothschild's giraffe species have seen an increase in their numbers, leading to an upgrade in their conservation status.  p 
 p Giraffes have never been considered to be at any big threat of disappearing, but the truth is -- they have been steadily decreasing in number over the years.  p 
 p However, this new classification came as a surprise even to some conservationists, as observing them often in zoos or in movies makes us believe "they will be fine" and we barely guess that they could be in danger. The cries for help have centred on rhinos, elephants and the illegal trade of pangolins for the last decade.  p 
 p The  strong dwindling populations of giraffe species -- some as low as 400   strong -- happened so quietly that barely anyone got an idea of the tallest land animals reaching so close to disappearing off the face of Earth. They are shockingly more endangered than any gorilla.  p 
 p Giraffes have  strong already disappeared from seven countries  strong  -- Eritrea, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Malawi, Mauritania, and Senegal. They have been in danger for the last century in Africa.  p 
 p As with the endangerment or extinction of any animal or plant species now, humans are at the root of it. Increased urbanisation, poaching, illegal hunting practices, and civil unrest in parts of Africa prove to be an increasing danger for giraffes.  p 
 p Other than poaching or villagers eating its meat for food scarcity, they are also shockingly killed just for their tails as they are seen as a status symbol in some cultures and can be used as a dowry, as per National Geographic reports by Jani Actman.  p
