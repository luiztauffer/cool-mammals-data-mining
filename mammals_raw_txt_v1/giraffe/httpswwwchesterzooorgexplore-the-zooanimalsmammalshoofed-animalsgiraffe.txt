 p They can grow to six metres high so you'll easily see their eye-bogglingly long necks and giant-sized legs, but did you know their tongues are a whopping length too?  p 
 p They can measure up to 45cm long – great for helping them pull down leaves, shoots, bark and flowers off tree branches to eat.   p 
 p Ours are Rothschild's giraffes, the world's second rarest kind of giraffe, with only a few hundred left in the wild.  p 
 p Just like no two humans have the same fingerprint, the blotchy pattern of each giraffe's coat is different from any other. But you can tell Rothschilds apart from other types of giraffe because they have no markings on their lower legs. Take a look, it's as if they're wearing white socks!  p 
 p Giraffes spend 16-20 hours a day feeding. Males feed with their neck and head stretched upwards, while females tend to put their head down, feeding off ground level grasses and shrubs. They have a special valve in their neck that stops the blood rushing to their head when they bend down.  p 
 p Our giraffes are all registered on the European Endangered Species Breeding Programme, which oversees the breeding of zoo animals in different countries.  p
