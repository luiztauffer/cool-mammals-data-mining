 p A giraffe, known as the gentle giant of nature, can sometimes turn out to be a killer.  p 
 p This behavior once observed by wildlife specialist Amy Attenborough was again reinforced after a giraffe kicked a farm worker to death outside Bela-Bela in Limpopo on Saturday.  p 
 p According to provincial police spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel, Moatshe Ngoepe, the 49-year old worker was feeding the animals when the giraffe kicked him in the stomach.   p 
 p The incident happened at a local safari lodge.  br   p 
 p His family was too distraught to speak to News24 on Saturday.  p 
 p "According to the information received, the paramedics were summoned and on arrival they tried to resuscitate him, but was later declared dead," Ngoepe said.  p 
 p He said the police in Bela-Bela have opened an inquest docket.  p 
 p Other incidents of giraffe attacks reported in 2018 includes that of an award-winning South African filmmaker, Carlos Carvallo, who died after being head-butted by the animal while filming at Glen Africa country Lodge in the North West in May.  p 
 p In September, Katy Williams and her three-year-old son were left critically injured when a giraffe that has just given birth attacked them at the Blyde Wildlife Estate in Hoedspruit.  p 
 p Attenborough once wrote: "Giraffes are well-versed in the art of self-defence to the point where even lions only dare to attack them in large groups.   p 
 p "A giraffe can kick in any direction and in a manner of ways, and its kick cannot only kill a lion, but has even been known to decapitate it."   p
