 p My Own Pet Balloons is all about imagination. Kids of all ages love to pretend, whether they&amp;rsquo;re taking their new pet Pony for a gallop, their penguin for a waddle, or their purple, pink and white Bunnies for a hop around the house. Best of all, there&amp;rsquo;s something for everyone: Puppies, Dinosaurs, a Pot-Bellied Pig and more.

 p Each My Own Pet balloon is brought to life by inflating it with helium. Once inflated, it immediately becomes ready for adventures. These re-fillable toys feed the imagination of their owners for 1-2 weeks before needing another "shot" of helium. Then they are ready to play again.
