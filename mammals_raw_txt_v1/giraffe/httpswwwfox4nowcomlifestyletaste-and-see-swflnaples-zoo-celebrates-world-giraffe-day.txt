 p The Naples Zoo celebrates World Giraffe Day on Saturday to help raise awareness for this species.  p 
 p According to the zoo, giraffe numbers have decreased by 40% in the last 15 years and the animal has gone extinct in seven African countries. The Naples Zoo supports the Giraffe Conservation Foundation in their work with governments, universities, and non-governmental organizations to support giraffe research and conservation across the country.  p 
 p Although the giraffe may be one of the best recognized animals across the country, the Naples Zoo says they are the least researched large animal in Africa.Â   p 
 p Celebrate World Giraffe Day on Saturday, June 16th from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. The day includes a giraffe themed scavenger hunt for a chance to win a zoo membership, five giraffe exploration stations and a chance to write thank you letters to rangers out in Africa who help protect these animals.  p
