 p Have you ever visited the local zoo and found yourself wondering how a juicy hunk of boiled penguin breast might taste? Just about every creature under the sun has been sautéed, deep-fried, and or sprinkled over a pizza at some point in human history.  p

 p Elephant feet: part of a complete breakfast! While exploring Mozambique in 1864, Scottish missionary David Livingstone was served this pedal delicacy, cooked in the “native fashion,” one morning. Finding it delicious,  a href="http:  www.theawl.com 2012 04 what-does-elephant-taste-like" target="_blank" the traveler wrote  a , “It is a whitish mass, slightly gelatinous, and sweet like marrow.” Best of all, the meal came with a healthy side of beer.  p 
 p “Properly prepared, and cooked rare,” pens celebrity chef  a href="http:  books.google.com books?id=TPWMzn4ztMgC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=giraffe+meat+taste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wpP0UuqGFaLXyAHryIEg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=giraffe%20meat%20taste&amp;f=false" target="_blank" Hugh Fearnly-Whittingstall  a , “giraffe’s meat steak can be better than steak or venison. The meat has a natural sweetness that may not be to everybody’s taste, but is certainly to mine when grilled over an open fire.”  p 
 p A particularly unflattering description of penguin meat composed by a a href="http:  www.south-pole.com p0000083.htm" target="_blank"  Belgian seaman  a  in 1898 suggests that it won’t be replacing chicken anytime soon: “If it’s possible to imagine a piece of beef, odiferous cod fish, and a canvas-backed duck roasted together in a pot, with blood and cod-liver oil for sauce, the illustration would be complete.”  p 
 p These hardy reptiles were a dietary staple to traveling sailors throughout the 19th century. Though many compared the delicacy to fine veal, a young Charles Darwin was decidedly  a href="http:  www.britishcheloniagroup.org.uk testudo v2 v2n5darwin" target="_blank" less enthusiastic  a . “[The] breastplate roasted … is very good,” his journal grants, “and the young tortoises make excellent soup, but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent.”   p 
 p Apparently, the king of the beasts makes for one tasty taco. A Tampa Bay restaurant began selling these $35 entrees last year before removing them from the menu a few months later. "[It's] surprisingly tasty,"  a href="http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=tllCqjcHXSQ" target="_blank" said one customer  a  of this exotic grub. "The taste is kind like venison, and the texture is kind of like gator."  p 
 p Looking to capitalize on Florida’s decades-long Burmese python invasion, Evan’s Neighborhood Pizza of Fort Myers now offers “Everglades Pizza” topped with slivers of these 20-foot snakes. “It tastes like chicken but chewier,”  a href="http:  www.willitsnews.com offbeat ci_25059197 python-meat-wriggles-atop-pizza-pies-florida" target="_blank" said one customer  a .  p 
 p It’s the perfect treat for hump day! Eating camel is a fairly common practice in much of the world, especially the Middle East.  a href="http:  www.theguardian.com lifeandstyle wordofmouth 2013 apr 16 camel-meat-one-hump-two" target="_blank" Chef Anissa Halou claims  a  it reminds him of “a cross between beef and lamb.” Camel steaks are becoming an increasingly popular alternative to conventional red meat in much of Europe and even parts of the U.S.  p 
 p Gorillas are widely hunted down and devoured in parts of Africa, and the simians’ flesh is routinely sold at nearby markets as “bush meat." Flavor-wise, many have cited their cuts as  a href="http:  www.bushmeat.org bushmeat_and_wildlife_trade what_is_the_bushmeat_crisis" target="_blank" rich, smoky, and veal-like  a . Speaking of primates, if you’d like to find out what humans taste like without wandering into Hannibal Lecter territory, Vsauce recently posted an  a href="http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=qWAF9PgDg2c" target="_blank" excellent video  a  on the subject.  p 
 p In the words of author and hunter  a href="http:  books.google.com books?id=Wh7gNQT5ni8C&amp;pg=PA198&amp;dq=hippo+meat+taste&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qiL1UuDtCOeayAGX14GoDA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hippo%20meat%20taste&amp;f=false" target="_blank" Peter Hathaway Capstick  a , “It is my personal opinion that hippo meat is one of the finest of game foods … The taste is mild, less than lamb and more than beef, slightly more marbled than usual venison. It tastes exactly like, well, hippo.”  p 
 p If you’re searching for an exotic alternative to traditional Thanksgiving fare, look no further. The eponymous host of the popular YouTube series “Dave’s Exotic Foods” stated in a  a href="http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=VlN_qeSPkrM" target="_blank" special holiday episode  a  that brined peacock sports a light and very turkey-like flavor. However, if certain medieval critics are to be believed, stocking up on some gas-ex first might be a  a href="http:  books.google.com books?id=jtgud2P-EGwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=peacock+meat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DS71UuO8GoaayQGmtoDYBQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peacock%20meat&amp;f=false" target="_blank" necessary precaution.  a    p 
 p “It was really, really tough and there really wasn’t much meat,” says American composer Aaron Paul Low, who helped catch and eat an unfortunate sloth on a trip to Peru in 2012. Tired of subsisting on nothing but indigenous fruits, Low claims his party “begrudgingly ate such natural wonders as armadillo, turtle, crocodile, toucan,” and many others. Sloth meat, he says,  a href="http:  gothamist.com 2012 04 25 all_yucca_and_all_fruit_make_new_yo.php#photo-1" target="_blank" isn't for the weak-stomached  a . “[It was] one of the few absolutely disgusting animals we ate.” These adorable tree-climbers are illegal to hunt, but a few luckless specimens still  a href="http:  io9.com 5886638 how-to-prepare-and-eat-a-sloth" target="_blank" get munched on  a  every year.  p 
 p Archaeological evidence suggests that prehistoric humans once  a href="http:  www.dailymail.co.uk news article-2217591 Wei-Guangbiao-Prehistoric-man-hunted-Giant-Pandas-spears-ATE-them.html" target="_blank" hunted giant pandas  a  with spears some 10,000 years ago. Since then, the practice has fallen out of favor and no record detailing their flavor is known to exist. However, in 1928, Teddy Roosevelt’s sons Kermit and Theodore IV hunted and ate one while visiting China, but  a href="http:  www.slate.com articles health_and_science explainer 2012 10 prehistoric_humans_ate_panda_what_do_panda_bears_taste_like.html" target="_blank" neglected to document  a  its taste.  p
