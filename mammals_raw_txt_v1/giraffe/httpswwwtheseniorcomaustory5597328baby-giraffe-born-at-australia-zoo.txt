 p class="story-paragraph" “As expected, Rosie gave birth to a very healthy female calf who shortly afterwards started walking and feeding from mum which is exactly what we want to see,” he said. br   p 
 p class="story-paragraph" “Rosie is a beautiful mum and this is her third calf she’s had here at Australia Zoo, so she’s relaxed and knows exactly what to do.  p 
 p class="story-paragraph" He said Rosie and her new baby are now bonding and spending “some important one-on-one time together”.  br   p 
 p class="story-paragraph" Over the next few weeks the pair will be slowly introduced into the rest of the herd where visitors should be able to see them.  p 
 p class="story-paragraph" Bindi Irwin said she was thrilled to have another giraffe addition to the Australia Zoo family.  p 
 p class="story-paragraph" “She is too cute for words,” said Irwin. “This gorgeous girl is certainly going to melt a lot of hearts with her big brown eyes.”  p 
 p class="story-paragraph" This birth is significant to giraffe populations as the species is considered vulnerable in the wild. Threats to these beautiful animals throughout African countries include poaching and habitat destruction.  br   p
