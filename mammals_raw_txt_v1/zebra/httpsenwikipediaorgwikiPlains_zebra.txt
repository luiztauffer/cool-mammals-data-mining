  p 
 p The plains zebra's range is fragmented, but spans much of southern and eastern Africa south of the Sahara. Its habitat is generally, but not exclusively, treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands, both tropical and temperate. They generally avoid desert, dense rainforest, and permanent wetlands, and rarely stray more than 30 km from a water source. Zebras of all ages are preyed upon by  a href=" wiki Lion" title="Lion" lions  a ,  a href=" wiki Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena" spotted hyenas  a ,  a href=" wiki Leopard" title="Leopard" leopards  a ,  a href=" wiki Cheetah" title="Cheetah" cheetahs  a ,  a href=" wiki Crocodile" title="Crocodile" crocodiles  a , and  a href=" wiki African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog" African wild dogs  a .
  p 
 p The plains zebra is a highly social species, forming harems with a single stallion, several mares, and their recent offspring; bachelor groups also form. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators rather than attempting to hide; they bark or snort when they see a predator, and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem. The species population is stable and not endangered, though some populations such as in Tanzania have declined sharply.
  p 
 p A dispute exists among biologists as to how to properly classify the various species of zebras. The plains zebra and  a href=" wiki Mountain_zebra" title="Mountain zebra" mountain zebra  a  are thought to belong to the  a href=" wiki Subgenus" title="Subgenus" subgenus  a   i Hippotigris  i  and that  a href=" wiki Gr%C3%A9vy%27s_zebra" title="Grévy's zebra" Grévy's zebra  a  is the sole species of subgenus  i Dolichohippus  i . This is on account of Grévy's zebra resembling an  a href=" wiki Asinus" title="Asinus" ass  a  (subgenus  i Asinus  i ), while the plains zebra and mountain zebra are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus  i Equus  i  along with other living equids. However, recent  a href=" wiki Phylogenetic" class="mw-redirect" title="Phylogenetic" phylogenetic  a  evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's zebras than mountain zebras. sup id="cite_ref-Vilstrup_5-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Vilstrup-5" [5]  a   sup  In areas where plains zebras are  a href=" wiki Sympatric" class="mw-redirect" title="Sympatric" sympatric  a  with Grévy's zebras, finding them in the same herds is not unusual, sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup  and fertile hybrids occur. sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-7" [7]  a   sup  In  a href=" wiki Captivity_(animal)" title="Captivity (animal)" captivity  a , plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.
  p 
 p In 2004, C. P. Groves and C. H. Bell investigated the taxonomy of the zebra genus,  i Equus  i , subgenus  i Hippotigris  i . They published their research in the journal  i Mammalian Biology  i . They revised the  a href=" wiki Subspecies" title="Subspecies" subspecies  a  of the plains zebra  i Equus quagga  i . Six subspecies are now recognised. sup id="cite_ref-iucn_1-3" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-iucn-1" [1]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Sometimes another subspecies is distinguished in Eastern Zimbabwe and Western Mozambique:
  p 
 p The quagga was originally classified as a separate  a href=" wiki Species" title="Species" species  a ,  i Equus quagga  i , in 1778. Over the next 50 years or so, many other zebras were described by naturalists and explorers. Because of the great variation in coat patterns (no two zebras are alike), taxonomists were left with a great number of described "species", and no easy way to tell which of these were true species, which were  a href=" wiki Subspecies" title="Subspecies" subspecies  a , and which were simply natural variants. The quagga was the first extinct creature to have its  a href=" wiki Deoxyribonucleic_acid" class="mw-redirect" title="Deoxyribonucleic acid" DNA  a  studied. Recent genetic research at the  a href=" wiki Smithsonian_Institution" title="Smithsonian Institution" Smithsonian Institution  a  has demonstrated that the quagga was in fact not a separate species at all, but diverged from the plains zebra, between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, and suggests that it should be named  i Equus burchellii quagga  i . However, according to the rules of  a href=" wiki Binomial_nomenclature" title="Binomial nomenclature" biological nomenclature  a , where two or more alternative names are given to a single species, the name first used takes priority. As the quagga was described about 30 years earlier than  Burchell's zebra, the correct terms apparently are  i E. quagga quagga  i  for the quagga and  i E. quagga burchellii  i  for the plains zebra, unless " i Equus burchellii  i " is officially declared to be a  i  a href=" wiki Nomen_conservandum" class="mw-redirect" title="Nomen conservandum" nomen conservandum  a   i .
  p 
 p Burchell's zebra was thought to have been hunted to  a href=" wiki Extinction" title="Extinction" extinction  a . However, Groves and Bell concluded in their 2004 publication that "the extinct true Burchell's zebra" is a phantom. Careful study of the original zebra populations in  a href=" wiki Zulu_Kingdom" title="Zulu Kingdom" Zululand  a  and  a href=" wiki Swaziland" class="mw-redirect" title="Swaziland" Swaziland  a , and of skins harvested on  a href=" wiki Game_farm" title="Game farm" game farms  a  in Zululand and  a href=" wiki KwaZulu-Natal" title="KwaZulu-Natal" Natal  a , has revealed that a certain small proportion shows similarity to what now is regarded as typical "burchellii". The type localities of the subspecies  i Equus quagga burchellii  i  and  i Equus quagga antiquorum  i  (the Damara zebra) are so close to each other that the two are in fact one, and that, therefore, the older of the two names should take precedence over the younger. They then say that the correct name for the southernmost subspecies must be  i burchellii  i , not  i antiquorum  i . The subspecies  i Equus quagga burchellii  i  still exists in KwaZulu-Natal and  a href=" wiki Etosha" class="mw-redirect" title="Etosha" Etosha  a .

 p The striping pattern of the zebra is unique among sympatric ungulates.

They rely on rainfall for food and water, and go on great migrations to follow the rains. The zebras migrate up to 700 mi (1,100 km) for food. Other grazers also migrate. Plains zebras are highly water-dependent sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup  and are usually found within 25–30 km of a water source.
  p 
 p In one study, the zebra's diet was estimated to be 92%  a href=" wiki Grass" class="mw-redirect" title="Grass" grass  a , 5%  a href=" wiki Herb" title="Herb" herbs  a , and 3%  a href=" wiki Shrub" title="Shrub" shrubs  a . sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-22" [22]  a   sup  Unlike many of the large ungulates of Africa, the plains zebra does not require (but still prefers) short grass to graze. It eats a wide range of different grasses, preferring young, fresh growth where available, and also browses on leaves and shoots from time to time. In consequence, it ranges more widely than many other species, even into  a href=" wiki Woodland" title="Woodland" woodlands  a , and it is often the first grazing species to appear in a well-vegetated area. sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup  Zebras have a simple stomach and use  a href=" wiki Hindgut_fermentation" title="Hindgut fermentation" hindgut fermentation  a  (caeco-colic), which allows them to digest and assimilate large amounts of forage. sup id="cite_ref-Moehlman_2003_23-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Moehlman_2003-23" [23]  a   sup  Thus, zebras are less selective in foraging, but they do spend much time eating. The zebra is a pioneer grazer and prepares the way for more specialised grazers such as  a href=" wiki Blue_wildebeest" title="Blue wildebeest" blue wildebeests  a  and  a href=" wiki Thomson%27s_gazelle" title="Thomson's gazelle" Thomson's gazelles  a , sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-3" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup  which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses.
  p 
 p The plains zebra's major predators are lions and spotted hyenas. sup id="cite_ref-Kingdon_1988_11-4" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Kingdon_1988-11" [11]  a   sup  Nile crocodiles are also great threats during migratory river crossings. African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards also prey on zebras, although the threats they pose are generally minor and they mostly attack the  a href=" wiki Foal" title="Foal" foals  a .  a href=" wiki Olive_baboon" title="Olive baboon" Olive baboons  a  may prey on foals, but pose no threat to adults. Zebras can be  formidable adversaries, since they have a strong bite and a kick powerful enough to kill land predators. They often try to outrun larger predators such as lions and spotted hyenas, whereas they often stand their ground with the smaller predators.
  p 
 p Plains zebra herds mix and migrate together with other species such as  a href=" wiki Wildebeests" class="mw-redirect" title="Wildebeests" wildebeests  a .

 p The plains zebra is highly social and usually forms small family groups called  a href=" wiki Harem_(zoology)" title="Harem (zoology)" harems  a , which consist of a single stallion, several mares, and their recent offspring. The adult membership of a harem is highly stable, typically remaining together for months to years. Groups of all male "bachelors" also exist.

 p A stallion defends his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues a warning to the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads, or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes, a stallion lies still on the ground as if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, he strikes and continues the fight. sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-9" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup  Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he usually is not challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then, the new stallion gradually takes over, pushing the old one out without a fight. sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-10" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup

The gestation period lasts around 360 to 396 days, and a single young is produced, which is capable of standing almost immediately and starts to eat grass within a week. sup id="cite_ref-arkive.org_33-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-arkive.org-33" [33]  a   sup 
Mares may give birth to one foal every 12 months. The birthing peak is during the rainy season. She nurses the foal for up to a year. The foal is weaned at 7 to 11 months and reaches puberty at 16 to 22 months.
The stallion is generally intolerant of foals that are not his. Zebras may practice  a href=" wiki Infanticide_(zoology)" title="Infanticide (zoology)" infanticide  a  and  a href=" wiki Feticide" class="mw-redirect" title="Feticide" feticide  a ; such incidences have been observed in both captive individuals sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-34" [34]  a   sup  and in nature.

 p For protection from land predators, the plains zebra retreats into open areas with good visibility at night. When the groups forage or sleep, one zebra  keeps watch, and if a predator is spotted, it barks or snorts loudly. sup id="cite_ref-Kingdon_1988_11-7" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Kingdon_1988-11" [11]  a   sup  When being hunted by hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra harem stays close together and cooperates to protect threatened members, sup id="cite_ref-Estes_1991_6-11" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Estes_1991-6" [6]  a   sup  particularly the young.

Cheetahs and leopards are mostly threats to foals, as an adult zebra is fully capable of driving them away.

 p Some local populations, though, have faced great declines and even extinctions. Though facing decline in numbers, the plains zebra population is thriving at about 750,000. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct. In Tanzania, the zebra population has decreased by 20% from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. sup id="cite_ref-iucn_1-6" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-iucn-1" [1]  a   sup  Zebras are threatened by hunting for their hide and meat, and habitat change from farming.

 p Zebras have been featured in African art and culture for millenia. They have been depicted in rock art in Southern Africa (modern Botswana, Nambia and South Africa) dating from 20,000–28,000 years ago, though not as commonly as antelope species like eland. How the zebra got its stripes has been the subject of  a href=" wiki Traditional_African_religions" title="Traditional African religions" folk tales  a , some of which involve it being scorched by fire. The  a href=" wiki San_people" title="San people" San people  a  associated zebra stripes with water, rain and lighting due to its dazzling pattern. The zebra has also been associated with beauty and the women of various societies would paint much of their bodies in stripes. For the  a href=" wiki Shona_people" title="Shona people" Shona people  a  of Zimbabwe, the zebra is a  a href=" wiki Totem" title="Totem" totem  a  animal, along with the eland, buffalo, lion and monkey. The zebra is praised in a poem as a "iridescent and glittering creature". Its stripes have symbolised the joining of male and female and at  a href=" wiki Great_Zimbabwe" title="Great Zimbabwe" Great Zimbabwe  a , zebra stripes decorate what is believed to be a  i domba  i , a premartial school meant to initiate woman into adulthood. In the  a href=" wiki Shona_language" title="Shona language" Shona language  a , the name "madhuve" means "woman women of the zebra totem" and is a given name for girls in Zimbabwe. sup id="cite_ref-reaktion_39-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-reaktion-39" [39]  a   sup
