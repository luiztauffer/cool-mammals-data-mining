 p An Egyptian zoo is insisting it did not paint a pair of donkeys to look like zebras.   p 
 p Cairo's International Garden municipal park became a target of ridicule after an Egyptian student, Mahmoud Sarhan, posted images on Facebook of the suspicious beast. Sarhan said that the zoo's two zebras were obviously painted donkeys, a view that has since been embraced by online animal experts.  p 
 p However, zoo director Mohamed Sultan told a local radio station that his zebras are real, dismissing claims that they are just painted donkeys,  a href="https:  www.bbc.com news world-africa-44968509?ocid=socialflow_twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" according to the BBC  a .  p 
 p This is not the first time that a zoo has painted donkeys to look like zebras. In 2009, a zoo in Gaza did the same thing, saying that it could not procure real zebras due to an Israeli blockade.  p 
 p "The first time we used paint but it didn't look good," the zoo's proprietor  a href="https:  www.reuters.com article us-gaza-zebras donkeys-get-dye-job-take-on-zebra-role-idUSTRE5973NV20091008" target="_blank" rel="noopener" told Reuters at the time  a . "The children don't know, so they call them zebras and they are happy to see something new."  p 
 p In 2013, a Chinese zoo was criticized for trying to pass off a large dog as a lion. "The zoo is absolutely trying to cheat us," one visitor told Chinese media. "They are trying to disguise dogs as lions."  p 
 p Zebras and donkeys, despite both bearing a resemblance to horses, are different species. Donkeys are popular beasts of burden in developing countries and were domesticated millennia ago. Zebras, meanwhile, are primarily known for their black-and-white stripes.  p 
 p Zebras also have black snouts, according to one expert. They are also larger and less donkey-like than the animal in the viral photo, and do not have smudged stripes.  p
