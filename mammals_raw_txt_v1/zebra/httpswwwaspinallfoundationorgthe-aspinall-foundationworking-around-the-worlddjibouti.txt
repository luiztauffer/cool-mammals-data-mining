 p The Grevy’s is the most endangered of the three main species of Zebra. In January 2015 Port Lympne Reserve sent three males,  span Casper, Babati and Karumwa, to the Decan Sanctuary in Djibouti. Considered extinct from this region of East Africa they are enjoying the 680-hectare reserve, located along the coast of the country, whilst acting as ambassadors for their species.   span   p 
 p  span Part of an initiative organised by  span   span Beauval Nature, in conjunction with Zoo Parc de Beauval, the aim is to raise awareness of the importance of conservation in Djibouti and educate future   span  span generations about the value of conservation and native wildlife. It was   span  span financially supported by   span  span The Foundation  span  span  and other zoological parks in France and Europe.  span   p 
 p Current estimates suggest there may be less than 2,500 Grevy’s living in the wild, and they have suffered one of the greatest reductions in the geographical area they inhabit than any African mammal. span  The Aspinall Foundation is delighted to be working   span with Zoo Beauval and their partners on this important project.  span The 20-hour trip marked the first time that zebra from our Kent reserve  span   span have been returned to their native land.   span   p 
 p  span With your support, we can run more programmes to help educate local communities about the importance of conservation and protecting wildlife.   span   p
