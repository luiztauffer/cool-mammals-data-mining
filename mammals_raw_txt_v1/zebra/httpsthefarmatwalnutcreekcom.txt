 p Located near the heart of Amish Country in Ohio, The Farm at Walnut Creek hosts over 500 animals, comprised of species from six of the seven continents.  Our menagerie includes exotic animals such as giraffes, camels, zebras, and kangaroos along with more common animals like horses, llamas, buffaloes and deer.  Visitors have the opportunity to view and hand-feed the animals from a conventional car or a horse-drawn carriage.  You can also get close to some of the animals in our petting area. br 
           br 
          We are a working farm and as such, the type of activities visitors may witness during a visit change with the seasons.  Depending on the time of year, you may see plowing, thrashing, canning, quilting and more.  You can tour our non-electric farm houses, buy produce at our farm stand, and take pictures of all that you see.  The Farm is a fun and educational experience for people of all ages. br
