 p Zebra herds are comprised of a harem of females and their foals, each led by a stallion. Females form their own hierarchy, with the stallion’s first mate at the top and newly-inducted females at the bottom. Stallions may bite, kick and circle their competitors to fight for females in their first estrus. To persuade these young females to join their harems, males may shower them with affection by grooming them. The winning male obtains mating opportunities for life.  p 
 p    p 
 p Though none have been proven conclusively, several theories attempt to explain the zebra’s stripes. The first states that stripes have an anti-predatory function by creating an “optical illusion”. The second points to a social role – each zebra is identifiable by its stripes and zebras with broader stripes receive more grooming. The third suggests the stripes help in thermoregulation and work as natural sunscreen. The last says they may protect against tsetse flies.  p 
 p    p 
 p Zebras are thought to have white coats and black stripes, drawn from observations that the underside of their belly and the inside of their legs are white. However, some zebras with genetic variations have a black coat with white stripes. Beneath their striped coat, zebras have black skin.  p 
 p    p 
 p Zebras are the first to move in during grass succession. By clipping away old growth and stems, they encourage the growth of young shoots. This opens up grazing opportunities for other animals like the wildebeests and gazelles, which are more picky about their food. Zebra herds leave the grazing area during the dry season. Their trampling of the land stimulates grass growth and increases the quantity and quality of vegetation for animal herds coming after them.  p 
 p    p 
 p While their meat is more often a last resort than a preferred choice, zebras are threatened by hunting through much of their range, especially when they move out of protected areas. Their population has reduced by 24% since 2002, which is worrying for a species considered common and widespread.  p 
 p The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is widely recognized as the most comprehensive, objective global approach for evaluating the conservation status of plant and animal species.  p
