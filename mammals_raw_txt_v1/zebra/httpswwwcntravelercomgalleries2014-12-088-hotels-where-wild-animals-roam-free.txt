Book one of their 16 open-air bungalows and monkeys, macaws, sloths, and toucans are just a few of the guests you’ll share your stay with. !--  react-text --   p

 p data-reactid="250" Despite the name, it isn't sea lions you should look out for here: A rookery of Gentoo penguins has been known to set up camp next to Sea Lion Lodge, a cozy 3-star hotel in the Falkland Islands. Aside from penguin spotting, the lodge offers expansive views of the South Atlantic Ocean where nothing but water separates you from Antarctica.  p

 p data-reactid="268" From an architectural standpoint, the Sarova Salt Lick Game Lodge is a sight to be seen, but the views from this stilted hotel are the real attraction. Located within the Taita Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, the lodge is perched above a watering hole. Spotting wildlife from your room window is possible at any hour of the day.  p

If you want to improve your chances, Buffalo Safari Jeep Tours leave every day from the lodge. And because the hotel sits within Custer State Park, a premier wildlife sanctuary, bison aren’t all you’ll see. !--  react-text --   p
