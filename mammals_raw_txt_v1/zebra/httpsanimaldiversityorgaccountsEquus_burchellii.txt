 p audience="advanced intermediate" With their distinctive black and white stripes, Burchell’s zebras are easily recognizable. The patterns of their stripes differ from other species of zebras. Their stripes are especially wide becoming wider and more horizontal towards the flanks and rear of the body. The stripes on the neck to the forelimbs are vertical. These neck stripes continue in the mane which is short and sticks straight up. In most populations, the stripes extend to the belly where they meet. Stripes on the limbs are narrower and horizontal and continue until reaching the hooves. Facial stripes are ordered both horizontally and vertically creating beautiful patterns. Not all stripes are distinctly black and white. Some stripes may appear a faint brown or may leave a brown “shadow” stripe in the white region. Within the species, geographical variation in the pattern of stripes exists. In the southern regions, populations tend towards fewer stripes, with a disappearance on the rear, limbs, and belly. They also have longer manes and tend to have stripes that are more buff and brown in color. Each individual's stripe pattern is unique and acts as an identifying characteristic similar to fingerprints in human beings.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#30cf4abeccaa361ef3ec94eb4703f017" class="citation" Cabrera, 1936  a ;  a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#6b5cd9ed4f5e8dd891ecb03a67ec30e6" class="citation" Groves, 1974  a ;  a href="#bd73d37f17f9c503d6336bb2f1c0fe4c" class="citation" Holland, 2003  a ;  a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a ;  a href="#05feafad5f30956c7eb972f955fff728" class="citation" Nowak, 1991  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Burchell’s zebras are polygynous; one male stallion leads and mates with a harem of females. Male-male competition is not significant, once males obtain a female, there seems to be a "gentleman's agreement" between the stallions that this female has been taken and cannot be lured away. Because of the lack of competition, males and females look generally the same, with males being only slightly larger than females. 
Females do not give outward signals of estrous, except for their first estrous. During their first estrous, females signal reproductive status to males through urine. These females take particular stances with their heads up, swan-like, legs straddled and tails up. She is then courted by several males in the area, by both dominant stallions leading a harem already and bachelor males looking for a harem. Eventually, one may try to “abduct” her from her natal group, but the dominant stallion, her father, tries to protect her and prevent her from leaving. Usually, the father is unsuccessful. Females do not ovulate during their first estrous. For the next two years after their first estrous, they will not copulate with males and may drift from group to group until settling on a harem for the remainder of their lives. Unless competing for females in their first estrous, males do not invest much in reproductive behavior. Male zebras fight for access to females in their first estrous. The outcome is vital because the winner of the fight obtains mating opportunities for life. Males bite, kick with their hooves, and circle their competitors. Males also show an excess of affectionate behavior, such as grooming, towards these young females to persuade them to join their harems.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#6b5cd9ed4f5e8dd891ecb03a67ec30e6" class="citation" Groves, 1974  a ;  a href="#934d6356611f52d91700e8f060835853" class="citation" Grubb, 1981  a ;  a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a ;  a href="#05feafad5f30956c7eb972f955fff728" class="citation" Nowak, 1991  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Burchell’s zebras can breed throughout the year. Most foals are born during the rainy season, which occurs from October to March in East Africa. The peak number of births occurs during the month of January. Each mare gives birth to only one foal after a gestation period of a little over one year. Mares pregnant with twins generally miscarry about 8 months into the pregnancy. When preparing to give birth, mares separate from the rest of the herd to hide from predators. While giving birth, foals and their mothers are extremely vulnerable to predation. Weaning is complete after 7 to 11 months but females may lactate up to 16 months. Young reach independence after 1 to 3 years, when they leave their natal groups. After 16 to 22 months, foals reach sexual maturity but neither males nor females will mate immediately. During this time, females have their first estrous and are “abducted” by outside males competing for them. Males will also leave the natal group at this time, when they roam with a bachelor group of males. If their mothers have another foal, they will leave earlier around the age of 1 years old but most males leave by the age of 2 years old. Young males in bachelor groups play and engage in mock fights, preparing for future fights when they begin searching for available mates and starting their own harems. When they reach 4 years old, males are finally prepared to fight for mates and establish a harem. Females can become pregnant almost immediately after giving birth while they are still lactating during a period called a "foal heat." An estrous occurs 7 to 9 days postpartum and 50% of females become pregnant again during this time. If this occurs, females are investing in two offspring simultaneously. The interbirth interval for Burchell's zebras is generally two years but because of this "foal heat," it can be as little as 13 months.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#d7432b1d29f42256bdb397ed68150bb2" class="citation" Fischhoff, et al., 2007  a ;  a href="#6b5cd9ed4f5e8dd891ecb03a67ec30e6" class="citation" Groves, 1974  a ;  a href="#05feafad5f30956c7eb972f955fff728" class="citation" Nowak, 1991  a ;  a href="#500e43244006e582bc557ab4892d3f57" class="citation" Pluhacek, et al., 2006  a )  span   p

Foals weigh about 32 kg when born and are well developed at birth, able to follow the mother back to the herd within a couple of hours. Within 10 or 15 minutes the foal can stand on its own feet and within an hour it is walking around and even running. Foals start to eat grass when they are only one week old. Weaning is complete after 7 to 11 months but females may lactate up to 16 months. During their close association, mothers and foals form especially tight social bonds. For a short period after birth, the mother will keep the foal away from the group, allowing the others to learn to recognize the newborn by smell, sight and sound. For the first year of its existence, the foal stays by the side of its mother learning to keep a watchful eye for predators, learning what grasses to eat, and learning the great migratory routes that cycle in the dry and rainy seasons. However, young males may also associate with their stallion fathers, learning male social behavior within a harem. Stallions offer parental care by defending the group from predators. The harem as a whole acts to defend foals against predators as well. When a member of the group is wounded, Burchell's zebras will surround the predator in a circle, biting and kicking until the predator succumbs or flees.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#d7432b1d29f42256bdb397ed68150bb2" class="citation" Fischhoff, et al., 2007  a ;  a href="#6b5cd9ed4f5e8dd891ecb03a67ec30e6" class="citation" Groves, 1974  a ;  a href="#934d6356611f52d91700e8f060835853" class="citation" Grubb, 1981  a ;  a href="#05feafad5f30956c7eb972f955fff728" class="citation" Nowak, 1991  a ;  a href="#500e43244006e582bc557ab4892d3f57" class="citation" Pluhacek, et al., 2006  a )  span   p

The dominant female preserves the rank order by leading the group in single file movements, in which mares line up according to age correlated rank.

During the night, at least one member of the harem remains awake hiding in tall grasses to guard and keep an eye open for nearby predators. When chased, individuals reach speeds up to 55 miles per hour. Their striped black and white body patterns are also anti-predatory adaptations, providing camouflage during the nighttime and under dim light. By blending together to look like a gray mass from a distance, the black and white stripes also make it difficult for predators to single out individuals to attack within the herd, a form of disruptive coloration. Also, an individual's stripes make it difficult for predators to discern between the zebra's body and the surrounding vegetation.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#6b5cd9ed4f5e8dd891ecb03a67ec30e6" class="citation" Groves, 1974  a ;  a href="#934d6356611f52d91700e8f060835853" class="citation" Grubb, 1981  a ;  a href="#44568aeb0673f44bc95063bd44402d4c" class="citation" Ruxton, 2002  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Burchell's zebras play an important role in the stability and dynamics of grazing communities where they live. They are an important portion of the east African ungulate faunas that make large-scale, 483 km migratory movements timed to the varying rainy season. They are the first to move in during grass succession, chomping down on old growth and stems which keeps vegetation young and growing. This opens up grazing opportunities for  a class="taxon-link" href=" accounts Connochaetes_taurinus " blue wildebeests  a ,  a class="taxon-link" href=" accounts Nanger_granti " gazelles  a , and  a class="taxon-link" href=" accounts Damaliscus_lunatus " topis  a  which are more picky about the vegetation they consume. Zebra herds leave the grazing area during the dry season and in doing so trample the land and stimulate grass growth. This, along with their selection of grass stems, increases the quantity and quality of vegetation for following animal herds. The sheer number of Burchell's zebras gives them a fundamental role in grazing communities. Without zebras, the old vegetation would not be cut back and other grazing animals could not obtain the new growth and higher nutritional leaves they need to survive. Thus, Burchell's zebras are important in maintaining the immense diversity that exists in grazing communities.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#c4833d6a1e89b9b1274164dd1928b367" class="citation" "African Wildlife Foundation: Burchell's Zebra", 2008  a ;  a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a ;  a href="#05feafad5f30956c7eb972f955fff728" class="citation" Nowak, 1991  a ;  a href="#e99c31d37dd1c3133ad2e3a78c5ee6d9" class="citation" Poole, 2006  a )  span   p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Roaming on the Serengeti plains, Burchell's zebras are charismatic animals that attract many people to ecotourism. In certain countries in Africa where other sources of income are unstable, ecotourism can provide a substantial contribution to the overall economy. Because of their distinctive stripes, zebras skins have been historically valuable and serve as an important commodity. Zebra meat provides food for local populations in need. Furthermore, as part of the native ungulate fauna of east Africa, they are critical in influencing vegetation dynamics, on which human cattle and other domestics rely.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Burchell's zebras are nearly harmless to humans, except for their adverse effect on the livestock industry in Africa. As herbivores, they compete with livestock for water, grass and space. However, they also improve the health of grasslands through their use of tougher plant stems and grass.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a ;  a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Of all the wild  a class="taxon-link" href=" accounts Equidae " equids  a , Burchell's zebras are the only species that are not severely threatened or extinct. However, their populations have declined in recent decades, especially in southern Africa. Habitat loss and illegal hunting are the two primary threats that Burchell's zebras face today. Expanding settlements and crop agriculture of growing human populations are destroying their habitats and blocking their cyclical migratory routes. This caused the near extirpation of Burchell's zebras from South Africa, Rwanda, and Angola. In areas where crop growth is difficult, Burchell's zebra populations compete for water and grass with domestic livestock. The presence of zebras near their livestock has led farmers and herders to hunting and fencing. The second primary threat Burchell's zebras face is from illegal hunting. Zebras are hunted for meat and for their skins. Zebra meat is hunted and eaten in local communities, so the hunting trade is locally and not internationally driven. Because zebras spread over large ranges, it is nearly impossible to follow and prevent illegal hunting. Hunting tends to be a larger threat in the northern regions of the zebras’ ranges where political unrest is more common. Seventy-five percent of the Burchell's zebra population is in Tanzania and Kenya. Therefore, the global population is vulnerable to the stability of these countries. Civil unrest and political strife in these countries may have severe impacts on the long term survival of these animals. Political instability corrodes the infrastructure of the park and wildlife reserve organizations needed to maintain ecotourism and conservation. Civil unrest also displaces people from their homes, spreading the range of their livestock into zebra territory and creating a greater demand for meat from the illegal trade.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#492d150d26b1e2c40a42e18029e9a29f" class="citation" Moehlman, 2002  a ;  a href="#e99c31d37dd1c3133ad2e3a78c5ee6d9" class="citation" Poole, 2006  a )  span   p 
 p audience="advanced intermediate" Four main theories have been purposed to explain the evolution of zebra stripes. The first theory states that these stripes have an anti-predatory function. The stripes may create an “optical illusion” which makes the zebras appear closer than they really are and predators leap too soon when they attack (disruptive coloration). Also, from a distance the black and white colors blend and the massive herd appears gray which enables them to hide better during the night and in dim light. This blending also makes it more difficult for predators to single out individuals from the herd. 
The second theory proposes that stripes evolved due to social benefits. The pattern of stripes is unique for each individual and serves as a means of identification. Social interactions are based on this particular identification. Studies show that individuals with more stripes receive additional social attention, such as grooming. With these social benefits, it would have been more advantageous to have more stripes. 
Thirdly, stripes may function in thermoregulation and provide as a natural suncreen. Differences in cooling of the black and white stripes create a rotary breeze. Lastly, these distinctive stripes may protect against  a class="taxon-link" href=" accounts Glossina_morsitans " tsetse flies  a . One study demonstrated that tsetse flies prefer solid verses striped objects. 
None of these theories have been tested thoroughly.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#060363d2214ace0aa772a503e45d7fff" class="citation" Eltringham, 1979  a ;  a href="#44568aeb0673f44bc95063bd44402d4c" class="citation" Ruxton, 2002  a )  span   p
