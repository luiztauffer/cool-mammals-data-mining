  p 
 p There are three species of zebras: the  a href=" wiki Plains_zebra" title="Plains zebra" plains zebra  a , the  a href=" wiki Mountain_zebra" title="Mountain zebra" mountain zebra  a  and the  a href=" wiki Gr%C3%A9vy%27s_zebra" title="Grévy's zebra" Grévy's zebra  a . The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus  i  a href=" wiki Hippotigris" class="mw-redirect" title="Hippotigris" Hippotigris  a   i , while Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus  i Dolichohippus  i . The latter resembles an  a href=" wiki Asinus" title="Asinus" ass  a , to which zebras are closely related, while the former two look more horse-like. All three belong to the genus  i Equus  i , along with other living equids.
  p 
 p The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as  a href=" wiki Grassland" title="Grassland" grasslands  a ,  a href=" wiki Savanna" title="Savanna" savannas  a ,  a href=" wiki Woodland" title="Woodland" woodlands  a , thorny  a href=" wiki Scrubland" class="mw-redirect" title="Scrubland" scrublands  a ,  a href=" wiki Mountain" title="Mountain" mountains  a , and coastal  a href=" wiki Hill" title="Hill" hills  a . Various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and  a href=" wiki Habitat_destruction" title="Habitat destruction" habitat destruction  a . Grévy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. While plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the  a href=" wiki Quagga" title="Quagga" quagga  a , became extinct in the late 19th century – though there is currently a plan, called the  a href=" wiki Quagga_Project" title="Quagga Project" Quagga Project  a , that aims to breed zebras that are  a href=" wiki Phenotype" title="Phenotype" phenotypically  a  similar to the quagga in a process called  a href=" wiki Breeding_back" title="Breeding back" breeding back  a .

 p Zebras evolved among the Old World horses within the last 4 million years. It has been suggested that zebras are  a href=" wiki Paraphyly" title="Paraphyly" paraphyletic  a  and that striped equids evolved more than once. Extensive stripes are posited to have been of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses). sup id="cite_ref-Hoofed_6-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Hoofed-6" [6]  a   sup  However, molecular evidence supports zebras as a   a href=" wiki Monophyletic" class="mw-redirect" title="Monophyletic" monophyletic  a  lineage. sup id="cite_ref-Vilstrup_7-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Vilstrup-7" [7]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-Forstén_8-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Forst%C3%A9n-8" [8]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-9" [9]  a   sup  The zebra has between 32 and 46 chromosomes, depending on the species.
  p 
 p There are three  a href=" wiki Extant_taxon" class="mw-redirect" title="Extant taxon" extant  a   a href=" wiki Species" title="Species" species  a . Collectively, two of the species have eight  a href=" wiki Subspecies" title="Subspecies" subspecies  a  (seven extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between, and the  a href=" wiki Taxonomy_(biology)" title="Taxonomy (biology)" taxonomic  a  status of, several of the subspecies are not well known.
  p 
 p The  a href=" wiki Plains_zebra" title="Plains zebra" plains zebra  a  ( i Equus quagga  i , formerly  i Equus burchelli  i ) is the most common, and has or had about six subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the common zebra, the  a href=" wiki Dauw" class="mw-redirect" title="Dauw" dauw  a ,  a href=" wiki Burchell%27s_zebra" title="Burchell's zebra" Burchell's zebra  a  (actually the subspecies  i Equus quagga burchellii  i ), Chapman's zebra,  a href=" wiki Johan_August_Wahlberg" title="Johan August Wahlberg" Wahlberg  a 's zebra,  a href=" wiki Frederick_Selous" title="Frederick Selous" Selous  a ' zebra,  a href=" wiki Grant%27s_zebra" title="Grant's zebra" Grant's zebra  a , Boehm's zebra and the  a href=" wiki Quagga" title="Quagga" quagga  a  (another  a href=" wiki Extinction" title="Extinction" extinct  a  subspecies,  i Equus quagga quagga  i ).
  p 
 p The  a href=" wiki Mountain_zebra" title="Mountain zebra" mountain zebra  a  ( i Equus zebra  i ) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as  a href=" wiki Vulnerable_species" title="Vulnerable species" vulnerable  a .
  p 
 p  a href=" wiki Gr%C3%A9vy%27s_zebra" title="Grévy's zebra" Grévy's zebra  a  ( i Equus grevyi  i ) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head, making it appear rather  a href=" wiki Mule" title="Mule" mule  a -like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid  a href=" wiki Grassland" title="Grassland" grasslands  a  of  a href=" wiki Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia" Ethiopia  a  and northern  a href=" wiki Kenya" title="Kenya" Kenya  a . Grévy's zebra is the rarest species, and is classified as  a href=" wiki Endangered_species" title="Endangered species" endangered  a .
  p 
 p Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a  a href=" wiki Dewlap" title="Dewlap" dewlap  a  and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grévy's zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra)  a href=" wiki Equine" class="mw-redirect" title="Equine" equines  a  have produced several distinct  a href=" wiki Hybrid_(biology)" title="Hybrid (biology)" hybrids  a , including the  a href=" wiki Zebroid" title="Zebroid" zebroid  a , zeedonk, zony, and zorse. In certain regions of Kenya, plains zebras and Grévy's zebra coexist, and fertile hybrids occur. sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-10" [10]  a   sup 
  p 
 p The  a href=" wiki Hagerman_horse" title="Hagerman horse" Hagerman horse  a  ( i Equus simplicidens  i ) is sometimes referred to as the  b American zebra  b  due to perceived similarities to the plains zebra, and sometimes depicted as striped. However, consensus appears to be that it wasn't particularly closely related to either  i Hippotigiris  i  nor  i Dolichohippus  i , nor is there unambiguous evidence that it had stripes. sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-11" [11]  a   sup 
  p 
 p The common plains zebra is about 1.2–1.3 m (47–51 in) at the shoulder with a body ranging from 2–2.6 m (6.6–8.5 ft) long with a 0.5 m (20 in) tail. It can weigh up to 350 kg (770 lb), males being slightly bigger than females.  a href=" wiki Gr%C3%A9vy%27s_zebra" title="Grévy's zebra" Grévy's zebra  a  is considerably larger, while the  a href=" wiki Mountain_zebra" title="Mountain zebra" mountain zebra  a  is somewhat smaller. sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-12" [12]  a   sup 
  p 
 p It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes, since some zebras have white underbellies. Embryological evidence, however, shows that the animal's background color is black and the white stripes and bellies are additions. sup id="cite_ref-Hoofed_6-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Hoofed-6" [6]  a   sup  It is likely that the stripes are caused by a combination of factors. sup id="cite_ref-BBCGill_13-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-BBCGill-13" [13]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-Post_2015_14-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Post_2015-14" [14]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-15" [15]  a   sup 
  p 
 p The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal.
  p 
 p A wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the evolution of the striking stripes of zebras. The more traditional of these (1 and 2, below) relate to  a href=" wiki Camouflage" title="Camouflage" camouflage  a .
  p 
 p Zebras have four  a href=" wiki Horse_gait" title="Horse gait" gaits  a : walk,  a href=" wiki Trot" title="Trot" trot  a ,  a href=" wiki Canter" class="mw-redirect" title="Canter" canter  a  and gallop. They are generally slower than horses, but their great  a href=" wiki Endurance" title="Endurance" stamina  a  helps them outrun predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator to attack. When cornered, the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.
  p 
 p Zebras have excellent eyesight. Like most  a href=" wiki Ungulate" title="Ungulate" ungulates  a , the zebra's eyes are on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have  a href=" wiki Night_vision" title="Night vision" night vision  a , although not as advanced as that of most of their predators. sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;" [ i  a href=" wiki Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"  span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

  p 
 p Zebras have excellent hearing and have larger, rounder ears than horses; like other ungulates, zebras can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to superb eyesight and hearing, zebras also have acute  a href=" wiki Sense" title="Sense" senses  a  of smell and taste.
  p 
 p Being an equid, zebras are subject to many of the same common  a href=" wiki Infection" title="Infection" infections  a  and  a href=" wiki Disease" title="Disease" diseases  a  of the domestic  a href=" wiki Horse" title="Horse" horse  a .
  p 
 p Two Grévy's zebras were  a href=" wiki Poison" title="Poison" poisoned  a  in 1995 by leaves from a hybrid red maple tree ( i  a href=" wiki Acer_rubrum" title="Acer rubrum" acer rubrum  a   i ) at the  a href=" wiki St._Louis_Zoo" class="mw-redirect" title="St. Louis Zoo" St. Louis Zoo  a . Horses were first reported in 1981 to be susceptible and even a small amount of the leaves can be toxic to  a href=" wiki Pony" title="Pony" ponies  a . In 2000, a zebra was reported to be infected with a nematode,  i halicephalobus  i , usually associated with decaying plant material. sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-25" [25]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly social. Their social structure, however, depends on the species.  a href=" wiki Mountain_zebra" title="Mountain zebra" Mountain zebras  a  and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of  a href=" wiki Hyena" title="Hyena" hyenas  a  or  a href=" wiki African_wild_dog" title="African wild dog" wild dogs  a  a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.
  p 
 p Unlike the other zebra species, Grévy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone. Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.
  p 
 p Like horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.
  p 
 p Zebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Grévy's zebras make mulelike brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.
  p 
 p Zebras feed almost entirely on grasses, but may occasionally eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their digestive systems allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.
  p 
 p Female zebras mature earlier than the males, and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.
  p 
 p Plains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mothers, as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grévy's zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector, since, as noted above, Grévy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.
  p 
 p Attempts have been made to train zebras for riding, since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. While occasionally successful, most of these attempts failed due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or  a href=" wiki Zebroid" title="Zebroid" zebroids  a  (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras. sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;" [ i  a href=" wiki Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"  span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

 p In England, the zoological collector  a href=" wiki Walter_Rothschild,_2nd_Baron_Rothschild" title="Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild" Walter Rothschild  a  frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907,  a href=" wiki Rosendo_Ribeiro" title="Rosendo Ribeiro" Rosendo Ribeiro  a , the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house calls.

 p Captain Horace Hayes, in "Points of the Horse" (circa 1893), compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days' time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the  a href=" wiki Burchell%27s_zebra" title="Burchell's zebra" Burchell's zebra  a  easy to break, and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the  a href=" wiki Tsetse_fly" title="Tsetse fly" tsetse fly  a . He considered the  a href=" wiki Quagga" title="Quagga" quagga  a  (now extinct) well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness. sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-26" [26]  a   sup

 p Modern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins, and for meat. They also compete with livestock for forage sup id="cite_ref-Competition_27-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Competition-27" [27]  a   sup  and are sometimes culled.
  p 
 p The Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction, with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. The population has since increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, but are still endangered.
  p 
 p The Grévy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless, they too have been reduced by hunting and loss of habitat to farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.
