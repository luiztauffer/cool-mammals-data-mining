 p The word "exotic" conjures up thoughts of faraway  places where strange animals inhabit sun-drenched islands. But in the  biological sciences realm, this word has come to be associated with unwelcome  visitors to our shores. Over the past 500 years, more than 4,500 foreign  species, including many harmful plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, and  pathogens, have established populations in the United States.                p 
 p    p 
 p One of these newcomers, the zebra mussel ( em Dreissena  polymorpha  em ), poses widespread ecological and economic threats. This small  freshwater mollusk originated in the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas region of  the former Soviet Union. By the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the  construction of extensive canal systems enabled the spread of zebra mussels to  almost all major drainages of Europe.  p 
 p    p 
 p In the United States, the first account of an established  population occurred in 1988 from Lake St. Clair, located between Lake Huron and  Lake Erie. By 1990, zebra mussels had been found in all five Great Lakes. Over  the next two years they made their way out of the Great Lakes through canals  and into the Illinois, Hudson, Arkansas, Cumberland, Hudson, Mississippi, Ohio,  and Tennessee rivers. As of 2011, the following states had reported zebra  mussels within, or in waters adjacent to, their borders: Alabama, Arkansas,  California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,  Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,  Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The mussels have  also been documented in over 600 lakes and reservoirs in the United States.  p 
 p    p 
 p Zebra mussels probably entered the Great Lakes when ships  arriving from Europe discharged ballast water containing a variety of aquatic  organisms, including zebra mussel larvae. The species rapid dispersal  throughout the Great Lakes and major river systems was due to its ability to  attach to boats navigating these waters. Zebra mussels have an even more  troubling characteristic: the ability to stay alive out of water for several  days under moist and reasonably cool conditions. Thus, overland dispersal is  another possible means of range expansion. An increasing number of small lakes  near, but not connected to, the Great Lakes are now inhabited by zebra mussels.  Beginning in 1993, many trailered boats crossing into California and other western states were found to have  zebra mussels attached to their hulls. These mussels, discovered at  agricultural inspection stations by informed officials, were removed before the  boats were allowed to continue.  p

 p Zebra mussels can grow to a maximum length of about 50  millimeters (1.9 inches) and live 4 to 5 years. Their common name was inspired  by their dark, zebra-like stripes. Although they are freshwater animals, zebra  mussels have recently been found living in brackish water with salinity levels  of 1 to 2 parts per thousand. Females generally reproduce in their second year.  More than 40,000 eggs can be laid in a reproductive cycle and up to 1 million  in a spawning season. The larvae emerge within 3 to 5 days after the eggs are  fertilized and are free-swimming for up to a month. Dispersal of larvae is  normally passive downstream. The mussels begin their juvenile stage by settling  to the bottom, where they crawl about by means of a foot searching for a  suitable firm surface or substratum upon which to anchor. Although hard,  calcareous materials, such as limestone, concrete, and the shells of other  mussels are preferred substrates, they will attach to various surfaces,  including water intake valves and pipes, and have even been found on vegetation.  Juvenile zebra mussels attach themselves by an external organ called a byssus,  which consists of many threads that adhere to a surface. Adults zebra mussels  filter about 1 liter (2.1 pints) of water per day while feeding primarily on  algae.  p 
 p    p 
 p Most of the biological impacts of zebra mussels in North  America may yet to be realized. However, they have the potential to harm native  mussels by interfering with their feeding, growth, movement, respiration, and  reproduction. Researchers are observing some of these effects as they study  interactions between zebra mussels and native mussels in the Great Lakes. In  one study, biologists found that where zebra mussel densities were highest, in  Lake St. Clair and in the western basin of Lake Erie, native mussels had  declined after only two years of zebra mussel colonization. Other studies have  shown an inverse correlation between zebra mussel biomass and the density of  native mussels. Scientists in the Great Lakes region are using models that may  predict the degree of loss based on zebra mussel densities. Unfortunately,  research shows zebra mussels prefer to attach to the shells of live mussels  rather than to dead ones or to stones. Some native mussels have been found with  more than 10,000 zebra mussels attached to them. Native species may not survive  if zebra mussels continue to colonize Lake St. Clair.  p 
 p    p 
 p Another exotic invader, the quagga mussel ( em Dreissena  rostriformis bugensis  em ), probably arrived at the same time as the zebra mussel.  Although the quagga mussel closely resembles its cousin, it is not expected to  have as great an impact on native mussels because it does not show a preference  for using them as substrates. Hoever, in the Great Lakes, the quagga mussel  appears to be outcompeting the zebra mussel to near exclusion. Quagga mussel  were contained to primarily the Great Lakes until 2007 when a very large  population was discovered in Lake Mead on the Colorado River in Nevada. Its  appearance was mostly likely the result of a contaminated boat entering the lake  coming from infested waters. This species is spreading in western states and  overall has been reported from the following states: Arizona, California,  Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico,  New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wisconsin. br 
   p 
 p The rapid spread of both mussel species has researchers  working together to help track this invading exotic. Many government and  private organizations are cooperating with U.S. Geological Survey researchers  at the  a href="http:  fl.biology.usgs.gov " Southeast Ecological Science Center  a  in Gainesville, Florida, by  reporting information on new sightings. This information becomes part of the  Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Information System, which distributes general  information available to government agencies, private groups, and the public.  The system also provides sound scientifc information to State and Federal  agencies responsible for the management of public lands. It is available at  a href="http:  nas.er.usgs.gov taxgroup mollusks zebramussel " http:  nas.er.usgs.gov taxgroup mollusks zebramussel   a . By working together, it  may be possible to control the continued spread of non-native pests like the  zebra mussel.  p
