	But first, the puffin. These are Arctic birds that nest on cliffsides and glide low over the water like " a href="http:  www.mnh.si.edu arctic html puffin.html" target="_blank" flying cigars  a ." But in England, they're also a type of pedestrian thoroughfare that relies on pressure pads and glowing icons. I find the first reference to a puffin crossing in the 1997  a href="http:  www.legislation.gov.uk uksi 1997 2400 schedule 4 made" target="_blank" screed  a , "Zebra, Pelican and Puffin Pedestrian Crossing Regulations and General Directions." Puffins were an attempt by the Department for (of) Transportation to standardize and simplify the country's myriad signaling devices, which sometimes cause " a href="http:  www.dft.gov.uk publications puffin-crossings" target="_blank" confusion and conflict  a " among the British populace.  p

	Puffin, if you're wondering, stands for a "Pedestrian User-Friendly INtelligent" crosswalk, geekoid language that wouldn't sound out of place coming from the metal mouth of a T-800:  p

	How do these doohickeys work? Let's start with their unique placement. Unlike standard walk signals, the screen with the red green human icons is placed on the near side of the street, so even legally blind folks can tell when it's time to cross. They are also faced diagonally from the curb so that pedestrians who check out the walk signals also have to look at approaching traffic, a built-in safety measure.  p 
 p 
	A pad or some other kind of sensing device lets the puffin know when somebody is waiting impatiently to cross. The equipment also keeps the do-not-walk signal up when somebody has pushed the walk button and then fled the scene, which is meant to " a href="http:  www.dft.gov.uk rmd project.asp?intProjectID=9275" target="_blank" remove the irritation  a  some drivers feel when stopped needlessly at existing crossings when there are no pedestrians waiting to cross," says the DF O T.  p 
 p 
	The puffin can intuit any pedestrian in the crossing zone who is walking at a speed of half a meter per second or above, and will keep the walking signal green to allow sluggish people more time to cross. Drivers may not like this feature, but hey, the puffin rules supreme.  p 
 p 
	Some folks claim that puffin crossings  a href="http:  www.youtube.com watch?v=8V-2_Hm7tpQ" target="_blank" have minds of their own  a , and will toy mercilessly with blokes they don't like, but that could also just be the result of a malfunctioning sensor.  p 
 p 
	That's enough with the puffins. Now, what about all the other animals in the zoo? Here's a brief field guide:  p

	 strong  a href="http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Panda_crossing" target="_blank" Panda crossing  a   strong : These are older-model crossings used in the U.K. in the 1960s under the reign of crack transpo director Marples, Ernest Marples. They employed triangle-shaped markings on the street rather than striped markings, because pandas are well-known for the perfectly triangular patterns all over their luxurious coats. After somebody pushed a button, the word "Cross" lit up on a board. There was no "Don't cross" signal, because litigious pedestrians could argue that the imperative tone of the phrase violates British right-of-way laws.  p
