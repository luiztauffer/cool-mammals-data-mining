 p Each year, Botswana’s zebra journey between Okavango Delta and Makgadikgadi Pans in search of fresh grazing in what is known as the second largest zebra migration in the world. Scattered herds of Botswana’s national animal can be seen throughout the Makgadikgadi palm belt and near the salt pans where the mineral content of grasses is highest. The nomadic habits of the Burchell’s Zebra in Botswana weren’t properly understood until tracking devices were used in a study done by the conservation group Elephants Without Borders in 2012. The scientists were amazed to discover that some zebras were trekking from as far away as the floodplains of Chobe near the Namibia–Botswana border, arriving in the Makgadikgadi area via Savute. This is a round trip of 500km, the longest of all recorded large mammal migrations in Africa. The most popular and well known location for viewing this beautiful spectacle is from Meno a Kwena camp situated along the Boteti River on the western boundary of the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park.  p 
 p class="uk-text-left" A far cry from the photographic safari-enthusiasts that visit Chobe National Park now, the park was once the haunt of large-scale ivory hunters. It’s hard to imagine that by the second half of the 19th century ivory hunting was so rife that elephants were almost extinct in the Chobe area. Today, “thlou” (the local Setswana term for elephant) are safe in Chobe National Park and…  p 
 p class="uk-text-left" The April May shoulder season is an excellent time to visit Botswana. By April, rainfall has almost completely ceased across the country, although there may still be a few scattered showers. Everywhere is still green and most pans still hold some water, but what is available is getting scarcer, forcing both predators and prey to stay near. Average daytime temperatures are now about 30°C…  p 
 p class="uk-text-left" Botswana’s Chobe and Savuti regions constitute a rich diversity of habitats that fall mostly within the boundaries of Chobe National Park, Botswana’s oldest wildlife reserve. The park was proclaimed in 1968 and protects an area of 11,700km2 that at the time of its formation was largely being ravaged by big game hunters and commercial logging. Chobe National Park is located in the…  p 
 p class="uk-text-left" October is Botswana’s hottest month and temperatures can exceed 40°C in the north of the country. The south is a bit cooler, but not by much. Nights in the south average between 15°C and 20°C, and in the far north are often much warmer. In the south and centre the rains usually come earlier, with the first afternoon thunderstorms bringing some relief. In the north, it rarely rains…  p 
 p class="uk-text-left" Botswana is a fascinating and stimulating country to explore for a family of wildlife and nature enthusiasts, but it is important to note which areas and which lodges offer the most in terms of family value. Activities designed for younger children are important, because game drives, walks, and mokoro cruises do have age restrictions. The best regions for a family safari, particularly…  p

These are two exciting and adventurous ways to travel through the country and give visitors the chance be exposed to the country on a more intimate level, in comparison to fly-in safaris, which are also far more expensive.

                    We spent 10 days in South Africa going around many places in December 2016. Every aspect was arranged perfectly and went really smooth. 

Our flight to Cape Town was very delayed and our pickup vehicle couldn't find us but the attention provided to us through customer service was really quick and professional and we got our pickup arranged in no time. Our special thanks to the Megan and Matthys for taking special care in suggesting the best ones considering our two young boys and our group of eight. 

Even though we have travelled across the world quite a lot we wanted to go with private guided tour this time and i should say we got the best guides from Hilton Ross arranged by Discover Africa team during our Cape Town stay. The whole trip was very memorable just because of the people part of Discover Africa Group.
