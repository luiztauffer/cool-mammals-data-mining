 p The word 'Africa' is an evocative one that usually goes hand-in-hand with mental images of vast savannah plains dotted with exotic game. The majority of overseas visitors to Africa will go on  a href="https:  www.tripsavvy.com africa-middle-east-4138799" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" safari  a , and in doing so discover that there is nothing more magical than a close encounter with the continent's famous  a href="https:  www.tripsavvy.com africa-middle-east-4138799" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" wildlife  a . Most of the species one sees on safari are unique to Africa, and many of them are instantly recognizable. In this article, we take a look at ten of the continent's most iconic animals, including those that make up the African  a href="https:  www.tripsavvy.com africas-big-five-safari-animals-1454083" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" Big Five  a .   p

However, whilst witnessing a kill is the ultimate prize, you're more likely to see one snoozing than in active pursuit of dinner. Lions spend up to 20 hours a day at rest, and are most active at dusk and dawn. They are the most social of all wild cat species, living in prides that typically consist of between five and ten adult lions. Tragically, lions are threatened by human expansion throughout Africa, with a  a href="http:  www.newsweek.com lion-populations-likely-decline-half-next-20-years-much-africa-387471" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" 2015 paper  a  prophesying that populations could fall by as much as 50% in the next 20 years.  p

Elephants are found in a wide variety of sub-Saharan habitats, including forests, deserts and savannah. They are herbivorous, processing up to 990 pounds  450 kilograms of vegetation per day. Although most elephants are peaceful by nature, they can be dangerous if provoked; however, they are far more at risk from humans than we are from them.   p

However, their distinctive brown and white markings serve as exceptionally good camouflage, and it's not unusual for giraffes to simply materialize out of the bush just a few feet away. There are nine subspecies found across sub-Saharan Africa, all of which boast blue tongues, stubby horn-like protrusions on their heads and of course, outrageously long necks. In order to be able to drink without losing consciousness, the giraffe's neck contains special veins and valves that regulate the flow of blood to its head.    p

Despite its wide range, leopards are amongst the most difficult of all safari animals to see, as they are both  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary nocturnal" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" nocturnal  a  and exceptionally wary of humans. Leopards use trees as observation platforms and for protection, and that is where they are most often spotted during daylight hours. They are solitary animals with exceptional predatory skills, including the ability to climb, swim and drag prey weighing up to three times their body weight up into the trees. Leopards are classified as Vulnerable on the  a href="http:  www.iucnredlist.org details 15954 0" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" IUCN Red List  a .   p

 p The easiest way to identify Africa's two species of rhino is by the shape of their bottom lip - square for white rhinos, and pointed for black rhinos. The survival of both species is threatened by widespread  a href="https:  www.savetherhino.org rhino_info thorny_issues poaching_crisis_in_south_africa" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow" rhino poaching  a , and the black rhino is considered to be critically endangered with fewer than 5,000 individuals left in the wild. White rhinos are more numerous and therefore easier to spot, especially in southern Africa. Shortsighted and usually solitary, rhinos are amongst the heaviest of all land mammals. An adult male white rhino averages around 5,100 pounds  2,300 kilograms.   p

 p African buffalo have a robust build and distinctive fused horns. They are grazers, typically moving in herds, with no natural predators except for lions and crocodiles. Unlike other species of wild buffalo, the African buffalo has never been successfully tamed, thanks to its naturally aggressive and unpredictable nature. Although seeing a buffalo herd ranging across the savannah is undoubtedly an unforgettable sight, it's important to treat these animals with respect.
