 p  a href=" wiki European_hedgehog" title="European hedgehog" European hedgehogs  a  were brought to  a href=" wiki New_Zealand" title="New Zealand" New Zealand  a  by European colonists in the 1870s  to remind them of their homeland. They  have now spread throughout the country, being absent only in inhospitable environments. The general public has a benign attitude to them but conservationists and regional councils regard these animals as pests as they prey on some native animals and compete with them for food.
  p 
 p Discussions on importing hedgehogs into New Zealand began as early as 1868. sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-1" [1]  a   sup  The first recorded introductions of the European hedgehog ( i Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis  i ) were by the  a href=" wiki Acclimatisation_societies_in_New_Zealand" title="Acclimatisation societies in New Zealand" Canterbury Acclimatisation Society  a  in 1870, with subsequent introductions in 1871, 1885, 1890 and 1894. It is likely that they all came from Britain. sup id="cite_ref-mammals_2-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-mammals-2" [2]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Beyond acclimatisation, hedgehogs were also introduced to control garden pests such as slugs, snails and grass grubs. sup id="cite_ref-doc1_3-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-doc1-3" [3]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Throughout much of the 20th century New Zealand-born hedgehogs were liberated in many parts of the country, sup id="cite_ref-mammals_2-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-mammals-2" [2]  a   sup  from those few animals, hedgehog numbers increased dramatically.  In the 1920s hedgehogs  were so numerous that they were blamed for reducing the tally of small game birds and a bounty was put on their noses.  By the 1950s hedgehog numbers reached their maximum.  To judge by roadkill figures, hedgehogs were 50 times more numerous in New Zealand than anywhere else.  Since the 1950s, their numbers have fallen but over large parts of New Zealand hedgehogs are still more numerous than in Britain. sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-4" [4]  a   sup 
  p 
 p By 1972 they may have reached their maximum range. sup id="cite_ref-mammals_2-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-mammals-2" [2]  a   sup  Today hedgehogs are present in almost all habitats, including urban, rural, braided river and forests areas.  The few areas they are not present in are inhospitable environments like above the permanent snow line and in the wettest parts of Fiordland. sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-5" [5]  a   sup 
  p 
 p Since coming to New Zealand the hedgehog has grown a little smaller and never reaches the size or weight of animals in Britain and continental Europe.  This is because European animals must reach a larger size and greater weight to survive the 6 month long  period of hibernation.  In central and southern New Zealand, hedgehogs hibernate for about three months of the year but few hibernate at all in the warmer northern parts of the country.

But it appears that none survived the six-month voyage to New Zealand in the 19th century, so the New Zealand animals are free of fleas. But they suffer from another ectoparasite - mange mites ( i  a href=" w index.php?title=Caparinia_tripilis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Caparinia tripilis (page does not exist)" Caparinia tripilis  a   i ) which are environmental and are not hedgehog exclusive. These mites bury their eggs in the skin where they later hatch and cause many health issues for the hedgehog host. The parasite blinds and kills large numbers of hedgehogs and probably played a big role in reducing their numbers. These are the same mites that may be carried by your domestic cat or dog and are environmental mites. sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;" [ i  a href=" wiki Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"  span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
