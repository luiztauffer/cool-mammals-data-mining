 p  My father was a firm believer in that bit of weather lore which suggested that the seasons always levelled themselves out – come cold or hot, wet or dry, at the end of the year the temperature range and the rainfall would be about normal. That is how it appears to be as of the end of November: “Be it dry or be it wet; the weather will always pay its debt”.   p 
 p  The spring and early summer this year were bitterly cold. Whichever direction the wind blew in from it had an icy edge. Because of the cold, the grass was slow to “get away”, a fact not appreciated by the cows and sheep.   p 
 p  Recently, though, for much of November in my neck of the woods, the weather has been warm, unseasonably balmy, with the grass growing, wildflowers in full bloom and pristine red admiral butterflies still flying. The flowers have been quite astonishing, with scarlet pimpernel, ox-eye daisies and chicory blooming as if it was high summer, and – how can I forget it – ragwort is enjoying the mild back end of the year as well. The mushrooms are still appearing and they have been joined by large numbers of the small and very attractive yellow toadstool, the “yellow cow pat” Bolbitius vitellinus. This thrives near cow pats and dollops of horse muck. It is, apparently, edible, but knowing its preferred environment (and warned off by that yellow colour), I don’t trust it, and I think I will give it a miss, thank you.   p 
 p  As I write I have just come in from checking the sheep on a blustery dusk. The girls are all loved-up with a hired Norfolk ram at the moment, a very handsome beast who will be on duty until Christmas. Walking home, I stopped: a barn owl was hunting erratically in the warm wind – what a pleasure to watch after the disastrous summer they had with so few of their chicks surviving.   p 
 p   strong A reader has kindly sent me  strong  an appeal leaflet published by the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust entitled The Last Hedgehog in Gloucestershire?. It is a remarkable piece of work as nowhere in its 14 pages is the word “badger” mentioned, and one of the main reasons for the disappearance of the hedgehog in recent years has been the booming badger population. The simple truth is that badgers are apex predators and they love hedgehogs, which are easy to catch and easy to eat if you are black and white with large claws and sharp teeth. The badgers have been helped by some farmers, including a number who moan about the creatures and who grow maize as cattle fodder and game cover. Badgers love maize, too: it’s another favourite snack.   p 
 p  I find both badgers and hedgehogs very attractive. But conservation should be driven by honesty, not by denial and political correctness, assisted by the omission of facts. Sadly, some “environmentalists”, and even people claiming to be biologists and zoologists, ignore the evidence concerning the relationship between badgers and hedgehogs which has been clear to country people for years. Clean “inside-out” hedgehog skins indicate that the former owner has been eaten by a badger. In 2013, I found a “badgered” hedgehog skin close to the farm and offered it to any doubters wanting to have it checked for badger DNA – there were no takers.   p 
 p  Michael Eavis, founder of the Glastonbury Festival, dairy farmer and vice president of the Somerset Wildlife Trust, joined the debate this week, saying: “I’m on the side of the hedgehog. There’s an unnaturally high number of badgers in the country.”   p 
 p  The science is clear, too: as Prof Timothy Roper points out in Badger (Collins Books): “Badgers are also significant predators of both adult and young western hedgehogs.”   p 
 p  Adam Tatlow, the gamekeeper who was the main subject of last week’s Diary, has some hedgehog observations. “Badgers don’t affect my work,” he says, “but there is a lack of hedgehogs and bumble bees and the badgers are absolutely devastating to both. Every year we have hedgehog boxes in our garden and we have at least one or two broods of hedgehogs – and I have a walled garden. While they are in the garden, they are safe and they do well, but as soon as they step outside they are doomed because of the concentration of badgers. They stand no chance. All the hedgehogs are killed within 200-300 metres of the garden wall.”   p 
 p  Now Oliver Colvile, MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, who doesn’t seem to understand the main reason for its demise, has proposed that the hedgehog should become Britain’s national animal. Sorry, Mr Colvile, as much as I love hedgehogs, and try to help them, you appear to be missing the point. To save the hedgehog we must have a badger policy based on contraception (delivered with raisins and peanuts), or on disturbance.   p 
 p  I am all in favour of people encouraging the wildlife they want, whether that is hedgehogs or badgers. But it is impossible to have large populations of both in the same area.   p 
 p  And as for a national animal, the choice is clear, and in certain areas achievable: the endangered red squirrel. Come on, you reds!   p
