 p audience="advanced intermediate" The European hedgehog is found in temperate fields, especially field edges and hedgerows. They prefer drier areas that are not thickly wooded and are occasionally found in scrub and sand dunes. European hedgehogs are commensal and are often found in home gardens, cemeteries, parks, agroecosystems, and other areas that provide appropriate places for hibernation.

They begin the mating process when a male encounters a female, at which time the male encircles the female while she lowers her head and makes a variety snorts, grunts, and hisses. If the male is successful in courting the female, he attempts to mount her several times. After numerous copulations, the male leaves the female, and does not provide any parental care to his offspring. He continues to roam alone and attempts to mate with other females until he begins preparing for hibernation.

 p audience="advanced intermediate"  span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species" Erinaceus europaeus  span  begins mating in late spring (April or May) when the the animal emerges from hibernation. Males, which emerge 3 to 4 weeks before females, expand their home range during mating season to increase chances of finding a mate. When a male finds a mate, he circles her while she lowers her nose and becomes audibly defensive. The male may circle for several hours, making several attempts to mount. If the female continually rejects the male, he eventually leaves to find a receptive female. If she accepts him, she flattens her spines and lowers herself to the ground, which gives the male better access. To copulate, a male climbs onto a female's back and uses his teeth to hold onto her shoulder. Gestation last for about 35 days. Females give birth to four to six offspring per litter, and often have two litters per year. The second litter, which is born later in the year, has a reduced chance of surviving winter. New borns are about 3 inches long and weigh 0.3 to 0.9 oz. At birth,  span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species" E. europaeus  span  does not appear to have spines, which are concealed beneath their fluid filled skin. 24 hours after birth, the fluid is absorbed and the spines are revealed, and, 2 to 3 days later, the young’s musculature is developed enough to allow it to hold the spines erect. These white adolescent spines are replaced by darker spines after about 1.5 days. Pigmented adult spines replace the first two coats after about 2 to 3 weeks, at which time young begin to open their eyes and learn how to roll into a ball. Young are weaned by 4 to 6 weeks old, after which they become independent of parental care, and are able to mate by about 1 year.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#C97E21B1-2781-4CBF-A79E-0979DABBA81D" class="citation" Bunnell, 2009  a ;  a href="#DE3A9231-FD0A-43EA-A9D2-D93248C71A75" class="citation" Burton, 1969  a ;  a href="#14A93EA6-5B6A-47C7-9D37-803FC7DEA9DF" class="citation" Johnston, 1903  a ;  a href="#E4071C29-6297-4B44-A6B9-022D072E0DD1" class="citation" Rondinini, 2007  a ;  a href="#EBA5F1D5-C81C-4575-86C8-A4FFE727FAFC" class="citation" Southern, 1964  a ;  a href="#9BFF8493-C780-408D-B93A-601FBFF047CD" class="citation" de Magalhaes and Costa, 2009  a )  span   p

In colder areas, hibernation usually begins in October and lasts until April; in warmer areas, hedgehogs may only hibernate during the coldest of winters. Hedgehogs survive the cold temperatures by storing fat to be used as insulation and as an energy reserve to wake up when necessary. These periodic breaks in hibernation occur every 1 to 2 weeks and last for 1 to 2 days, during which hedgehogs forage for food and urinate. Provided sufficient resources, captive hedgehogs do not hibernate.  p

 p audience="advanced intermediate" Hedgehogs are routinely kept as pets, but the European hedgehog is forbidden as a pet in Europe. Due to their broad diet, hedgehogs may help control insect pests. They have proven useful for the study of numerous diseases including foot and mouth disease, yellow fever, and influenza. Their hair and spines are useful in assessing for environmental pollutants including arsenic, silver, cadmium, lead, cobalt, and Persistant Organic Pollutants (POPs). Traditional remedies have incorporated the blood, entrails, or ashes of European hedgehogs, and some rituals involving hedgehogs have been used to cure baldness and predict the weather. Ancient Romans raised hedgehogs for their meat, and they used parts of the hedgehog, especially their spiny coat, for training work animals.  span class="citations"  ( a href="#DE3A9231-FD0A-43EA-A9D2-D93248C71A75" class="citation" Burton, 1969  a ;  a href="#9BA414E5-B959-48EA-A37C-2A36A7ECC71D" class="citation" D'Havé, et al., 2005  a ;  a href="#5E0F007E-0090-4F0B-B679-214B660A0E5E" class="citation" D'Havé, et al., 2006  a ;  a href="#8E9D123D-CD7C-428E-B8F8-071E1E5CD9EA" class="citation" Hof and Bright, 2010  a ;  a href="#EBA5F1D5-C81C-4575-86C8-A4FFE727FAFC" class="citation" Southern, 1964  a ;  a href="#8E95E831-71C0-4829-A381-0F7B764E500C" class="citation" Vermeulen, et al., 2009  a )  span   p
