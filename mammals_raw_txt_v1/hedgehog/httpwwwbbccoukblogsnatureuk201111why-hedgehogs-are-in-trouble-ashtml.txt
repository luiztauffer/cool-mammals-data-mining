 p  strong Guest post: The usual advice when dealing with wildlife is leave well alone. In the case of  a href="http:  www.bbc.co.uk nature life European_Hedgehog" hedgehogs  a , however, and especially at this time of the year, rules are there to be broken, and here's why, says Pauhla Whitaker from the Help A Hedgehog Hospital in Gloucestershire.  strong   p 
 p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0pt auto 20px; width: 595px; color: #666666;" If we don't help our hedgehogs, they could be gone by 2020 © Julien Crowther  p 
 p This is the time we start to see autumn juveniles out and about. These are young hedgehogs from the second litter of the season and if they are small then they are in real trouble. Annie Parfitt, manager at our hospital, recommends that hedgehogs should weight at least 600g or more in order to survive hibernation. Any lighter than that and they will not have the fat reserves to get them through winter and death is a certainty. The tragedy is we are seeing more and more underweight hogs later in the season.  p 
 p So why is this? Well, with nature, there are always many factors at play but our changing and unpredictable weather seems to be the biggest culprit. Imagine a cold, hard winter with prolonged frost and long periods of snow cover, followed by a dry but not particularly warm spring. Sounds familiar doesn't it? If you believe the weather predictions, this winter is going to bring more of the same.  p 
 p This spring, hedgehogs that made it through hibernation woke up as the days warmed up and lengthened, only to find there was little spring rain in many parts of the country. As a consequence, the bugs, beetles, worms and other invertebrates they rely on for food were in short supply. This meant that their the breeding season was delayed and although the first litters of hoglets will have survived, the second litters were born very late.  p 
 p style="font-size: 11px; margin: 0pt auto 20px; width: 595px; color: #666666;" Hedgehogs need to weigh at least 600g to survive hibernation © Damon Cannard  p 
 p We had another dry spell in many areas in late summer and food was in short supply again, so these vulnerable babies will have been struggling not only to find enough food, but to eat enough of it in time to get up to hibernation weight before the cold weather set in again. The situation was bleak. Judging by the numbers of juveniles we are already seeing admitted to our hospital alone, the doom-laden predictions were spot on.  p 
 p Already, you can see how easy it is for hedgehog numbers to be drastically affected by one bad season but the knock-on effects will spill over to next year. This is because hedgehogs are not sexually mature until a year of age so if they were born later in the spring than normal, they may not breed at all in their first year and if they do, their own first litters may also be late-born and consequently not survive the winter.  p 
 p Add to that habitat pressure from urban in-fill, increased traffic and new roads carving up traditional hedgehog routes plus many, many other factors and you can see how precarious a balance it is.  p 
 p Hedgehogs are nocturnal nomads, travelling between one and two miles a night to forage for food. They are not easy to count but the best estimates we have say that numbers have declined from over 30 million in the 1950s to around 1.5 million now. They are now listed as an endangered species. If the decline continues, we will lose our last hedgehog by 2020.  p 
 p  strong But don't despair. Here's what you can do to help:  strong   p

 p We over-wintered 84 autumn juveniles last winter and virtually all of them survived to be released this spring. We always release in pairs or trios of one male and two females and never release littermates together to ensure genetic diversity and reduce the chances of in breeding where populations may be small.  p 
 p We've had reports from the public of released hedgehogs taking up residence in their gardens and going on to successfully raise a litter. To know that in our small way we have helped to ensure the survival of another generation of this ancient and endangered animal is a feeling beyond description.  p

 p Thank you for the advice on last weeks autumnwatch. I had no idea of the danger they were in. I had a hedgehog coming into my garden (my first experience of them) for the previous few weeks, so after watching autumnwatch, I caught and weighed the hedgehog only to find he was just over 400grams. A carer came and collected him, so he is now safe and happy!  p

 p Hi to all the Guys at AutumWatch. br Thank you for the information you gave last friday on hedgehogs. I have always had Hogs in my garden but asumed I should leave them alone, I had no idea about the trouble they were in!  I am pleased to say that since last weekend I have built a feeding station out of bricks and slabs and have been feeding them every night.  They are loving the mealworms, cat biscuits, sunflower hearts and raisans.  But not so much the banana chips!! I will be weighing them now that I have scales.  I love these little guys and I hope that we all can make a differance. br Happy Hedgehog feeding :O) br  br Avid fans Chloe and Anna  (Kent)  p

 p Thank you for great advice on Autumnwatch. I've been feeding our resident and visiting hedgehogs for several years now, and am now more than a bit upset that I didn't argue more last year. When the snow hit Kent quite hard last November, we had two young hedgehogs in the garden at their food bowl, with the snow landing on them. I did everything I thought I should, brought them in and weighed them, and they were only 550 grams each. I phoned a number I found on the Hedgehog Preservation Society website for advice, and was told to put them back in the garden, despite the snow, as they often wouldn't hibernate until around January, and just to keep putting food out. I don't see how they could have made it through from last year. Luckily we have more youngsters around at the moment, but sometimes, its not easy to do the right thing.  br Gill  p

 p lovely to hear more on hedgehogs.We live in a village near dartmoor and over the last 5yrs have been geeting hedgehogs in our garden, this year word must have got around  in hog  hear say as we have had 38 at different times all are marked in a certain way (little paint marks and colours so we know each one and also have recorded times dates in nest etc} these last few days we only have 4 left as they are trying to put the weight on they are babyies from august september doing well as they are roughly 550 grams upwards . We thought that seeing they was alright  we could just sit down and enjoy them on the webcams i have fitted in the garde but last night {thursday) a little one weighing just 300grams came in although lively br he was cold so he will be our first 1 to  have a bed in our shed for the winter i thing there will a few more like this one as it must be from a very late litter  hopefully they will be on the lookout for their buddy yours :doglodgeannie  p

 p Thank you so much for the info last week. We've been feeding what is probably a family of hedgehogs for the last few months and had a wee one appear recently - only 370g. So he's now on his winter hols with a lovely carer and hopefully we'll get a much bigger hog back for release next spring!  p

 p I saw a hedgehog on our sideway paving about a week ago and he looked quite small.  After seeing the Autumnwatch article we built a feeding station and, every night this week the food put out has been eaten, although we miss the arrival of the animal.  I will be keeping a watch this weekend and will see if we can get hold of it to weigh.  It's actually been nice to see them as we used to get lots back in Essex but didn't see any up this way for some years.  p

 p Hi all and thanks for such positive stories and comments. br I just wanted to say thank you to Hugh Warwick, who I am sure you know of if you are at all interested in hedgehogs, and who will hopefully have time to come on and leave a message here as his knowledge of hedeghogs is incredible! He has been in touch regarding hibernation weights and pointed out that a hog under 600g at hibernation is not necessarily doomed as I said in the blog so HUGE apologies if I have scared you all silly with a very poor choice of words!  br Since appearing on the show we have had quite a few emails from people who have had conflicting advice from various sources and from the blog posts, it seems people here have had a similar experience. As Hugh pointed out, work done by Dr. Pat Morris has shown that the minimum weight for hibernation is 450g but the chances of survival increases with weight. br The advice from the British Hedgehog Preservation Society on their website and in the leaflet they issue to their carers is that any hog weighing under 600g in September should come in for extra feeding. They also say hogs can be released in the winter if the weather is mild and there is a suitable hibernation site but they advise not releasing them until they are 800g and waiting till spring if the weather is going to be changeable (crystal balls needed for that decision I suspect!) br At Help A Hedgehog Hospital, we generally take in hedgehogs at this time of year if they are under 600g, although if it is only a few grams short then we usually advise people to put down food and monitor the situation. br As Hugh Warwick has said, the situation is complicated by many factors and the study in this is ongoing so recommendations may well change as knowledge increases. What is really fantastic is that the issue of weight is now in people’s minds, and judging by the stories here, “unviable” hedgehogs are being taken into rescue in good time to feed up and release at a later date and that is great news all round!  p

 p We discovered how endangered Hedgehogs were a few months back through a newspaper article written by a lovely lady called Anni who offers care and rehabilitation for hedgehogs in Braunton, North Devon. We now look after some of the hogs when needed and also help soft release them back to the wild through our woodland when they are fit and well enough. We are also in the process of setting up a website for North Devon Hedgehog Care &amp; Rehabilitation over the next few weeks so keep your eyes peeled!  p

 p Hi Hedgehog friendly. You will often be told that fish-based cat food isn't ok for hogs but the general feeling is that it won't do any harm. It's just that they often turn their noses up at it. Having said that, I have been told by several carers that "their" hogs love it. It's down to personal taste I guess.  p

 p I have noticed an unexpected problem while out walking and conducting research into a project. When I was younger I always wondered where the elastic bands came from that were on my doorstop but now I know as the postmen drop them on the streets. I was shocked at the amount there were for me to pick up when going for a short walk with my dog (link for picture -  a href="http:  www.flickr.com photos 55314368@N05 6389080217 in datetaken " http:  www.flickr.com photos 55314368@N05 6389080217 in datetaken   a  ). I know these can be a huge danger to wildlife, hedgehogs included which are already in a lot of trouble. Regarding this issue and other dangers the hedgehog faces do you think they will become extinct in the UK in the future and what can we do regarding the elastic band problem?  p

 p We found a little hedgehog in Pershore yesterday afternoon, and thanks to the info on Autumnwatch took him to the Vale Wildlife Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre just outside Evesham. Wonderful place - they have over 100 hedgehogs to care for. He weighed just 323 gms, and has already had fluids twice, a blood test and wormers for capellaria worms, and antibiotics. And a bit of food. Fingers crossed, and he'll make it through. But - it costs on average £100 to see a little hedgehog like him through the winter, and I'm beginning to see why. Brilliant website on www.valewildlife.org.uk - lovely pics of catering on a grand scale for the spiny residents! They need our support.  p
