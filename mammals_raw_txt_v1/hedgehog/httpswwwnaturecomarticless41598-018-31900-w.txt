 p Sporadic cases of herpesvirus-associated disease have been reported in the Western European hedgehog ( i Erinaceus europaeus  i ), but there has been little surveillance for, nor any sequence characterisation of, herpesviruses in this species to date. A nested pan-herpesvirus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a region of the DNA polymerase gene was used to test 129 Western European hedgehogs from across Great Britain, 2011–2016; 59 (46%) of which were PCR-positive. In addition, samples from two previously published cases of fatal herpesvirus infection in  i E. europaeus  i , from Sweden and Switzerland, were positive using this PCR. No statistically significant relationship was detected between PCR result and sex, age class, year or season for the British hedgehogs tested. In most PCR-positive animals (19 22) from which liver and brain were tested separately, both were PCR-positive. Sanger sequencing of amplicons from 59 British hedgehogs revealed at least two novel viruses within the  i Gammaherpesvirinae  i . Thirteen of these hedgehogs had liver and brain tissues screened for microscopic abnormalities, of which one had non-suppurative meningoencephalitis, but neither intranuclear inclusion bodies nor herpesvirus virions (on electron microscopical examination) were identified. Sequencing of the whole DNA polymerase gene confirmed two genetically different  i Human alphaherpesvirus 1  i  viruses in the Swedish and Swiss hedgehogs.  p

Each carcass was either examined upon arrival or was frozen at −20 °C pending examination. Age class was assigned based on dentition (deciduous versus permanent teeth). Where possible, a standard set of tissues, including liver and brain, was archived at −80 °C. Where the state of tissue preservation permitted, a standard set of tissues, plus any detected lesions, was fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin. The date when, and location where, the animal was found dead, the age class and the sex were recorded for each hedgehog.  p 
 p A convenience sample of liver and brain tissues from 129 free-living hedgehogs was included in the current study. Each hedgehog had been found dead or had been euthanased, 2011 to 2016. Cases with available liver and brain tissues were selected from the archive of 185 hedgehogs to ensure all years and geographical regions were represented. The majority (59%, n = 76) of these 129 hedgehogs were found dead by members of the public. The remainder were submitted by wildlife rehabilitation centres. Where information on duration of time in care was available, 82% (42 51) had died or had been euthanased within 48 hours of admission, therefore findings were presumed to reflect their health and infection status in the wild.

The Swedish hedgehog herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene sequence differed from that of  i Human alphaherpesvirus 1  i  by two non-synonymous substitutions (threonine to proline). A nucleotide mismatch in the 286 nucleotide segment of the Swiss hedgehog herpesvirus also resulted in a non-synonymous substitution (threonine to isoleucine), compared to  i Human alphaherpesvirus 1  i .

There was no apparent predisposition to infection by sex, age class, year or season. In Great Britain, the PCR-positive hedgehogs had a wide spatial distribution with no apparent evidence of geographical clustering, except that expected from a convenience sample (e.g. increased submissions from areas local to a wildlife rehabilitation centre). These findings indicate that HHGHV-1 is endemic in the free-living hedgehog population in Great Britain, with infection being spatio-temporally widespread at moderately high occurrence. In contrast, HHGHV-2a and HHGHV-2b were each found in only one hedgehog and whether these viruses are also endemic in the British hedgehog population requires examination and sequencing of HHGHVs from a larger sample of hedgehogs across Great Britain.  p

Although this virus was not proved to have caused disease in the Swedish and Swiss hedgehogs, the presence of viral particles was closely associated with the observed lesions and such a causal relationship seems likely. It should be noted that both of these hedgehogs were held in captivity at wildlife treatment and rehabilitation facilities, therefore there was opportunity for close contact with people which is unlikely to occur with free-living hedgehogs. Our results highlight the anthroponotic potential of this virus and the need for people working with this species to practice good hygiene and biosecurity.  p
