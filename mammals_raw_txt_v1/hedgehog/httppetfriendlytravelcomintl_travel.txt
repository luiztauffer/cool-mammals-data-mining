 p 
Taking a pet to a foreign country involves preparation and planning far in advance of your departure date. Requirements for pet travel are set by the destination country. If you are you travelling to another country and bringing along your pet you’ll need to meet the animal health requirements of the country you are visiting. As soon as you know your travel details, contact your local veterinarian to assist with the pet travel process. Factors to consider may include meeting time frames for obtaining a health certificate, updating vaccinations, diagnostic testing, or administration of medications  treatments. Prepare well in advance for traveling. Some countries require blood tests at least 6 months before departure to prove that your pet is vaccinated against rabies.

International health certificates for the export of animals from the United States are completed by the accredited veterinarian who certifies herd and animal health status, conducts tests, and records test results for the individual animals being exported. Completed and signed international health certificates for the export of animals from the United States must be endorsed by a Veterinary Services area office in order to be valid.
  p 
 p 
If you are taking your pet out of the United States to another country, whether permanently or for a visit, you should do the following:
  p 
 p 
1. All veterinarians must be licensed or legally able to practice veterinary medicine in the state that they work.  In addition to a state veterinary license, many countries require the veterinarian who issues (completes and signs) the international health certificate to be USDA-accredited. You should contact your local veterinarian to see if he or she is currently USDA-accredited through the National Veterinary Accreditation Program (NVAP). This is especially important when traveling to a country that requires an Accredited Veterinarian’s signature – because if they are not, you’ll need to find a veterinarian who is to complete your paperwork. If you are traveling with a bird, make sure that your veterinarian has the appropriate accreditation status for completion of international health certificates for birds (Category II).  a target="_blank" href="https:  www.aphis.usda.gov aphis ourfocus animalhealth nvap" Find an Accredited Veterinarian  a 
  p

2. Veterinary Services (VS) Endorsement Offices are responsible for the endorsement of your pet's International Health Certificate.  While there are VS Endorsement Offices located in most U.S. States, all appointments and questions are routed through six primary locations. Contact your local VS District Office to determine the best way to get your documents endorsed. Options generally include mailing your documents or scheduling an appointment with the Area Office.

Pet cats and dogs can be imported into Canada for any period of time without quarantine from any country; however, there are different requirements for cats entering from either rabies-free countries or from those countries that Canada does not consider to be free of rabies. br 
Pet cats and dogs must be accompanied by a valid rabies vaccination certificate, which is issued by a licensed veterinarian(2), in either English or French and which clearly identifies the cats or dogs and states that they are currently vaccinated against rabies. This certificate should identify the animal as in breed, colour, weight, etc., and indicate the name of the licensed rabies vaccine used (trade name), including serial number and the duration of immunity (otherwise, it will be considered valid for one year from the date of vaccination). Cats and dogs do not require a rabies vaccination or certification if they are less than three (3) months of age at the time they are imported into Canada. Cats and dogs three (3) months of age or older arriving from a country officially recognized by Canada as being rabies free do not have to be vaccinated against rabies, although vaccination is strongly recommended. br 
Canadian Customs does not require you to have a health certificate for your pet, but if the animal is travelling to Canada by air, the commercial airline may require a health certificate. Contact your airline for additional information on their requirements. br

Dogs and cats must have a valid rabies vaccination. In the case of primary (first) rabies vaccination the vaccination must be given not more than 12 months and not less than 30 days before the date of import.

The regulations surrounding transporting animals are dependent on what type of animal and the country in question. If your pet is a dog, cat or ferret, you can benefit from the Pet Travel Scheme which enables these pets to move between EU and listed countries with relative ease and without quarantine, once you have complied with the requirements. In December 2014, the rules changed to further define these animals – canis lupis familiaris (dog), felis silvestris catus (cat), and mustela putorius furo (ferret). These terms do not, however, cover hybrid animals, including bengal cats and wolfdogs. The Pet Travel Scheme is valid for countries in the EU and specified listed countries. These countries are deemed as not having a higher risk of rabies than the EU countries or member states
