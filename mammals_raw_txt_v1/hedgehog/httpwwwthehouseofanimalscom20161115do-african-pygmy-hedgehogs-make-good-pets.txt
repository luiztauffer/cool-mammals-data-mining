 p I have kept African Pygmy Hedgehogs (APH’s) for a number of years now. Each one has been a rescue, and people are often fascinated by these creatures. I regularly get asked if they make good pets, so I thought I would share the most common questions I get asked on them.  p 
 p It’s true. Here in England, we do have a species of wild hedgehog called the European hedgehog  em (Erinaceus europaeus).   em The African Pygmy Hedgehog is very different to the European Hedgehog and is believed to be a hybrid of the Algerian ( i Atelerix algirus)   i and Four Toed Hedgehog ( i Atelerix albiventris)  i . They originate primarily from Nigeria and the African continent, where they were brought over and quickly became popular pets, with breeding pairs selling for thousands of pounds on the exotic pet market in the 90’s.  An exotic animal exporter, Richard Stubbs was approached by local men from Kano in 1991, who were selling hedgehogs, claiming they were overpopulating the area. Stubbs purchased 2,000 of the hedgehogs for 50 cents each and shipped them to New York. Although not pygmy, they were called Afican Pygmy Hedgehogs and became very popular. Word spread about these creatures and in 1993, due to demand becoming so high, Stubbs found it more difficult to source hedgehogs in Kano, so looked further a field in Nigeria, Niger and Benin. Approximately 80,000 hedgehogs were imported into the USA, by Stubbs and other exotic animal importers and these hedgehogs make up the base population of hedgehogs we see today. In 1994, the exportation of hedgehogs stopped when the US Department of Agriculture enforced a 90 day quarantine period on all animals who were imported from countries that had the foot and mouth disease, which included African countries making it hard to import new hedgehogs.  p 
 p Whilst it is illegal to keep a wild hedgehog, it isn’t illegal in England to keep African Pygmy Hedgehogs.  p 
 p Although smaller than European Hedgehogs, African Pygmy Hedgehogs need a lot of room, and they also need to be kept warm. I have kept my APH’s in vivariums and zoozones, but I prefer the vivarium set up as it offers more room. They are solitary animals, so should not be kept together and spend a lot of time walking around their home. In the vivarium, I use fleece on the floor, and they have a bed to sleep in, as well as a wheel, which is placed in the litter box. The reason for this is APH’s like to run on their wheel and poop, so it makes it easier to keep them clean. They are an exotic animal, and therefore require heat. I use ceramic heat emitters attached to a thermostat to keep them around 75 degrees. The heat source is attached at one end to allow a heat gradient, which means my APH can warm up by going closer to the heater, or cool down by going to the other end of the vivarium. They do enjoy enrichment too, and most of mine like tunnels to run through and I also give them cat toys, such as balls with bells in, to keep their minds active as they are adventurous and curious. A wheel is a must as in the wild, they can walk up to 5 miles a night!  p 
 p I feed my APH’s a mix of different cat biscuits and meal worms. They can have other live food,  but my current hedgehogs refuse anything else. It is important to add they should not be fed any fish as it isn’t safe for them. They are prone to obesity, so it’s important to make sure they don’t eat too much, and exercise as much as possible.  p 
 p I do find APH’s poop does smell pretty bad, and their cage will smell if you don’t keep on top of cleaning. They are messy little critters and like to poop on their wheel which makes a mess. Their wheels need cleaning daily, and often, so does the APH as they get poop stuck on their feet and quills.  p

 p APH’s are nocturnal, so running on the wheel and scuffling around their cage is noisy. I kept my first APH, Dexter in my room and he would keep me awake with his nighttime antics. My APH’s are currently kept in another room in the house at night, which means I don’t hear them with my bedroom door shut.  p 
 p Vivariums are not cheap, neither is the heating equipment which is vital for them. There is also a high chance your APH will have to see a vet at least once in it’s life, and you will have to take them to an exotics vet which is expensive. A lot of vets, even exotics vets will not treat APH’s as they are so specialised, so it’s important to find a good vet before you decide to get one. They are prone to cancer, mites and Wobble Head Syndrome (WHS) which is a genetic disorder which causes progressive paralysis. Sadly, there isn’t a cure and the hedgehog will slowly get worse and will then become completely paralyzed.  p 
 p They usually live around 3-6 years.  p 
 p Some don’t mind being handled, others don’t. If you want a tame APH, you need to handle them regularly to get them used to you. A happy hog will put it’s quills down so you won’t get spiked, but unsocialised hogs will puff up their quills and hiss and huff at you. They are very delicate and need to be handled carefully. One of my APH’s, Arnold Schwartzenhogger came to me because his previous owners couldn’t hold him. Whilst he is a lot better now, he prefers to do his own thing, so I don’t force anything with him.  p 
 p A strange behaviour APH’s do is something called anointing. It can be a shock to new owners as they foam at the mouth and flip their heads round, but it’s completely normal. APH’s will anoint when they encounter a particular smell which could be your perfume, a new disinfectant or food. No one is entirely sure why they do this, but it could be a defensive mechanism against predators.  p 
 p I am very pro-rescue, and all of my APH’s have been rescues. Because they are so popular now, there are a lot of people who cannot keep theirs. It’s always nicer to give an unwanted APH a home, so look up you local exotic rescue if you do want one.  p 
 p In conclusion, I love these little creatures, however, they aren’t for everyone. If you do decide to adopt one, do a lot of research before committing to them as there is a lot to learn. Talk to your local rescue to find out more.  p
