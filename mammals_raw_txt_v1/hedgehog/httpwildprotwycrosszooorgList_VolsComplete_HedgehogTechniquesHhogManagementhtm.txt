 p Catching and
      handling of non-domestic animals requires an understanding of general
      principles as well as a recognition of the difficulties and problems which
      may be associated with the species in question.  p 
 p It is always important
      to consider the risk of injury to humans and to the animal which is being
      caught or held in order to reduce the risk of injuries to humans or
      animals.

 p Accommodation
      requirements vary between different species, although there are principles
      which apply generally to animals and to non-domestic animals in
      particular.  p 
 p Incorrect housing is likely to increase the stress
      experienced by a non-domestic animal while it is in care and may result in
      injury to the animal. A knowledge of natural history is beneficial when
      designing accommodation, in order to understand the physical and social
      requirements of the species.

 p There are
      obviously wide variations between diets suitable for different species.
      Diets fed to non-domestic animals must meet their nutritional needs and
      should be presented in a manner such that they are recognised as food.
      Incorrect diets may delay wound healing and cause illness. Knowledge of
      the natural diet of the species is useful when designing diets.

 p Euthanasia is
      sometimes the most humane option for a wild animal. It is important to

      method of euthanasia is most appropriate for the individual animal and
      circumstances.

      opening a door or window and letting the individual go. There are many
      factors which should be considered when releasing an animal. Some of these
      factors are related to the individual and others to the habitat into which
      it will be released.

      and Tracking  font   p 
 p Studies on
      many aspects of wild animal behaviour require that individuals can be
      repeatedly identified. This is very important in research regarding the
      survival of wild animal casualties after they have been rehabilitated and
      released. Marking may also be important for individuals in care, in order
      to identify group-maintained individuals (e.g. litter mates). More
      detailed studies of animals in the wild often require that individual
      animals can be tracked over a period of time.

      necessary by further diagnostic tests such as radiography (x-ray
      examination). If a hedgehog has dies or requires euthanasia then a  i post-mortem  i 
      examination may be beneficial to give a definite diagnosis; this may
      provide a diagnosis for other animals which are still alive (e.g.
      littermates) and improve care of animals in the future. Obviously it is
      beneficial when making a diagnosis to have a knowledge of which diseases
      may occur in hedgehogs, which parts of the body they affect and which
      diseases and conditions are common and therefore most likely to be seen.

      treatment due to their spines and, in particular, their ability to roll up
      into a ball. The following techniques describe methods of treating
      hedgehogs which take account of the potential problems inherent with these
