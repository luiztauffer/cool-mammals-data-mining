There are seventeen species of hedgehog in five  a href=" wiki Genus" title="Genus" genera  a  found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. There are no hedgehogs native to Australia and no living species native to the Americas (the extinct genus  i  a href=" wiki Amphechinus" title="Amphechinus" Amphechinus  a   i  was once present in North America).
  p 
 p Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with  a href=" wiki Shrew" title="Shrew" shrews  a  (family Soricidae), with  a href=" wiki Gymnure" title="Gymnure" gymnures  a  possibly being the intermediate link, and they have changed little over the last 15 million years. sup id="cite_ref-13_ways_2-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-13_ways-2" [2]  a   sup  Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a nocturnal way of life. sup id="cite_ref-nocturnal_3-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-nocturnal-3" [3]  a   sup  Their spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated  a href=" wiki Porcupine" title="Porcupine" porcupines  a , which are rodents, and  a href=" wiki Echidna" title="Echidna" echidnas  a , a type of  a href=" wiki Monotreme" title="Monotreme" monotreme  a .
  p 
 p The name  i hedgehog  i  came into use around the year 1450, derived from the  a href=" wiki Middle_English" title="Middle English" Middle English  a   i heyghoge  i , from  i heyg  i ,  i hegge  i  ("hedge"), because it frequents hedgerows, and  i hoge  i ,  i hogge  i  ("hog"), from its piglike snout. sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-4" [4]  a   sup  Other names include  i urchin  i ,  i hedgepig  i  and  i furze-pig  i .

  p 
 p Hedgehogs are easily recognized by their  a href=" wiki Spine_(zoology)" title="Spine (zoology)" spines  a , which are hollow hairs made stiff with  a href=" wiki Keratin" title="Keratin" keratin  a . sup id="cite_ref-Attenborough_5-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Attenborough-5" [5]  a   sup  Their spines are not  a href=" wiki Poison" title="Poison" poisonous  a  or  a href="https:  en.wiktionary.org wiki barb" class="extiw" title="wikt:barb" barbed  a  and unlike the quills of a  a href=" wiki Porcupine" title="Porcupine" porcupine  a , do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called "quilling". Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress.
  p 
 p A defense that all species of hedgehogs possess is the ability to roll into a tight ball, causing all of the spines to point outwards. sup id="cite_ref-Attenborough_5-1" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Attenborough-5" [5]  a   sup  The hedgehog's back contains two large muscles that control the position of the quills. When the creature is rolled into a ball, the quills on the back protect the tucked face, feet, and belly, which are not quilled. Since the effectiveness of this strategy depends on the number of spines, some desert hedgehogs that evolved to carry less weight are more likely to flee or even attack, ramming an intruder with the spines; rolling into a spiny ball for those species is a last resort. The various species are prey to different predators: while forest hedgehogs are prey primarily to birds (especially  a href=" wiki Owl" title="Owl" owls  a ) and  a href=" wiki Ferret" title="Ferret" ferrets  a , smaller species like the  a href=" wiki Long-eared_hedgehog" title="Long-eared hedgehog" long-eared hedgehog  a  are prey to  a href=" wiki Fox" title="Fox" foxes  a ,  a href=" wiki Gray_wolf" class="mw-redirect" title="Gray wolf" wolves  a , and  a href=" wiki Mongoose" title="Mongoose" mongooses  a .
  p 
 p Hedgehogs are primarily  a href=" wiki Nocturnal" class="mw-redirect" title="Nocturnal" nocturnal  a , though some species can also be active during the day. Hedgehogs sleep for a large portion of the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug in the ground, with varying habits among the species. All wild hedgehogs can  a href=" wiki Hibernation" title="Hibernation" hibernate  a , though not all do, depending on temperature, species, and abundance of food.
  p 
 p Hedgehogs are fairly vocal and communicate through a combination of grunts, snuffles and or squeals, depending on species.
  p 
 p Hedgehogs occasionally perform a ritual called  a href=" wiki Self-anointing_in_animals" title="Self-anointing in animals" anointing  a . sup id="cite_ref-National_Wildlife_1_June_2005_6-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-National_Wildlife_1_June_2005-6" [6]  a   sup  When the animal encounters a new scent, it will lick and bite the source, then form a scented froth in its mouth and paste it on its  a href=" wiki Spine_(zoology)" title="Spine (zoology)" spines  a  with its  a href=" wiki Tongue" title="Tongue" tongue  a . The purpose of this habit is unknown, but some experts believe anointing  a href=" wiki Camouflage" title="Camouflage" camouflages  a  the hedgehog with the new scent of the area and provides a possible poison or source of infection to predators poked by their spines. Anointing is sometimes also called  a href=" wiki Anting_(bird_activity)" title="Anting (bird activity)" anting  a  because of a similar behavior in birds.

 p The  a href=" wiki Olfactory_system" title="Olfactory system" olfactory regions  a  have not been thoroughly studied in the hedgehog.

 p During hibernation, the body temperature of a hedgehog can decrease to about 2 °C (36 °F). When the animal awakes from hibernation, the body temperature rises from 2–5 °C (36–41 °F) back to its normal 30–35 °C (86–95 °F) body temperature. sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-10" [10]  a   sup

The average litter is 3–4 newborns for larger species and 5–6 for smaller ones. As with many animals, it is not unusual for an adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.
  p 
 p Hedgehogs have a relatively long lifespan for their size. Larger species of hedgehogs live 4–7 years in the wild (some have been recorded up to 16 years), and smaller species live 2–4 years (4–7 in  a href=" wiki Captivity_(animal)" title="Captivity (animal)" captivity  a ), compared to a mouse at 2 years and a large  a href=" wiki Rat" title="Rat" rat  a  at 3–5 years.

Squamous cell spreads quickly from the bone to the organs in hedgehogs, unlike in humans. Surgery to remove the tumors is rare because it would result in removing too much bone structure.
  p 
 p Fatty liver disease is believed by many to be caused by bad diet. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods that are high in fat and sugar. Having a metabolism adapted for low-fat, protein-rich insects, this leads to common problems of obesity. Fatty liver disease is one sign, heart disease is another.
