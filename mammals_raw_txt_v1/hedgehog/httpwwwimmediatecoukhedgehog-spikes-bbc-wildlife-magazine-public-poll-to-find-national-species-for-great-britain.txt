 p style="text-align: left;" The hedgehog should become the UK’s national wildlife icon, so says the results of a poll carried out by  strong BBC Wildlife Magazine  strong  i ,   i one of the world’s most prestigious natural history titles, published today [31 July 2013].  p 
 p Winning 42% of the 9,108 votes cast, the prickly insectivore was placed ahead of the badger, which took almost 24% of the vote and the oak tree, which took 10% of the vote.  p 
 p  Ben Hoare, Features Editor of ‘ i BBC Wildlife Magazine’,   i commented:  p 
 p “ i It seemed curious to us that a country of nature lovers, gardeners and ramblers should not have a wild animal or plant emblem to call its own. We think our readers have picked an admirable national wildlife icon for Britain in the hedgehog. T  i  i hese spiny wonders gobble up garden pests and become incredibly tame – you won’t find anyone with a bad word to say about Mrs Tiggy-Winkle.”   i   p 
 p The public poll to find a wildlife icon was launched as part of celebrations to mark  i ‘BBC Wildlife Magazine’s’  i  50 sup th  sup  anniversary. Unlike many other countries around the world, the UK has never had a national plant or animal to call its own. In the title’s June 2013 issue, ‘ i BBC Wildlife Magazine’  i  asked 10 leading conservation charities to nominate the species they believed should be the UK’s national species and invited readers and members of the public to vote for their favourite.  p 
 p Ann Widdecombe, one of the hedgehog’s highest-profile champions and patron of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society, said:  p 
 p  i “I’m over the moon that the hedgehog came top in the ‘BBC Wildlife Magazine’ poll. It is a quintessentially British creature.”  i  But she added:  i “We all need to rally to help the species, which is declining at an alarming rate.”  i   p 
 p The top 10 candidates for a national species for Great Britain, according to ‘ i BBC Wildlife Magazine’,   i are:  p
