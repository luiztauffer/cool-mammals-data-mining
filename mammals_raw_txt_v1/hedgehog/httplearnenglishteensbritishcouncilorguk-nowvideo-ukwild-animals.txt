 p What happens to animals when they get injured? Watch this video about a rescue centre that takes care of all sorts of wild animals.  p 
 p Do the preparation task first. Then, watch the video and do the exercises. Remember you can read the transcript at any time.   p 
 p This video is part of our  a href="http:  learnenglish.britishcouncil.org en word-street" rel="nofollow" Word on the Street  a  series. Word on the Street is an exciting new English Language teaching programme co-produced by the BBC and the British Council.  p 
 p Britain is a nation of animal lovers. From the cute and cuddly to slimy and scary, we love them all.  p 
 p Some of us have a passion for our pets, the animals that become part of the family. But here at the Wildlife Rescue and Ambulance Service, they are wild about wildlife.  p 
 p London is home to millions of people but it’s also home to many wild animals and sometimes they can get hurt.  p 
 p Here at the centre, the staff look after injured or very young animals and then hopefully get them well enough so they can go back into the wild. It’s hard work looking after them. The first task of the day is serving breakfast.  p 
 p Most of the people who work here are volunteers. None of them are paid. They help out and provide their time for free, for the love of the animals.  p

 p  strong Joe  strong : Hi Barry.  p 
 p  strong Barry Smitherman  strong : Hi Joe.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : I’m here to help.  p 
 p  strong Barry Smitherman  strong : Great. There’s a spare broom here.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : Great. Thank you very much. So tell me about the rescue centre, Barry.  p 
 p  strong Barry Smitherman  strong : Primarily our work here is to care for sick and injured animals and birds and where possible release them back into the wild where they belong.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : And you’re a charity, aren’t you?  p 
 p  strong Barry Smitherman  strong : Yes, we are. Obviously we rely upon donations to keep the work going, by people coming and visiting us at the centre and seeing some of our animals and kind donations from the public.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : And with this many animals here there’s obviously a lot of work to do.  p 
 p  strong Barry Smitherman  strong : Yes, yes, it’s not easy. There is always a lot to do.   p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : Well, let’s get going.  p 
 p  strong Barry Smitherman  strong : Good idea.  p 
 p align="center" .....  p 
 p Loss of natural habitat has led to wildlife and humans living in closer proximity to each other than ever before. When man meets animal, it’s the wildlife that often comes off worse. Road traffic accidents, poisoning and attacks from domestic pets often cause injury.  p 
 p When the animals are first brought in, they often need treatment here at the animal hospital. Let’s go and visit some of the patients.  p 
 p align="center" .....  p 
 p June takes care of the baby animals. Some of the tiny ones need a lot of attention.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : So what’s wrong with this hedgehog, June?  p 
 p  strong June Smitherman  strong : This hedgehog was attacked by a dog and it’s got two wounds: one underneath, one on top.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : And what sort of treatments are you going to give him?  p 
 p  strong June Smitherman  strong : Well, I’ll give him a course of antibiotics. Hopefully that should make him better.  p 
 p  strong Joe  strong : And will he be released into the wild?  p 
 p  strong June Smitherman  strong : Not this one because this one’s not going to be fit enough so this one will stay with me until next year.  p 
 p align="center" .....  p 
 p Now it’s a big moment as one of the little hedgehogs is going to be released back into the wild.  p 
 p When this little chap arrived he wasn’t strong enough to feed but now he’s well enough to survive in the wild. The big question is: will he want to leave?  p 
 p Well, he’s not too sure at first. But now he’s made it back to where he belongs - in the wild. And it’s thanks to this and other rescue centres across Britain that more animals are free to be wild again.  p 
 p What animals live in your local area? Have you ever helped a sick or injured animal?  p

 p My neighbor has a beautiful dog-Golden Retriever. His name is Max. But wild animals like wolf,bear or fox don't live near my city.  My city doesn't have a lot of forest, meadow and therefore there are not many wild animals.  p

 p Hi from Georgia:))   p 
 p I love animals but are some varities that I'm afraid of:( I think we'll do everything to protect them from danger,because some bad people  are hunting  and they want to kill them for different reasons:to enjoy,for food and etc. I think The goverment must do something to survive them!  p

 p what does this word mean "donation' and "chap"?  p 
 p class="submitted" 
        p 
 p Hi tiko lobjanidze! I'll try to answer your questions.  p 
 p A  strong donation   strong is a gift of money. The animal centre in the video needs donations so it can keep on taking care of the animals - I think that costs a lot of money. A  strong chap   strong just means a man - but it's a friendly-sounding word (and a bit old-fashioned). In the video when they say 'this little chap', they're talking about the hedgehog. They call it a chap because they like the hedgehog and think of it a bit like a human, not just an animal!  p 
 p Does that help? Did you enjoy the video?  p

 p This video is very interesting! I think that everyone should save aminals which are in danger, they are part of our life and we must help them. In my country live many kind of animals, but some of them are in danger becouse of hunting .So we must stop hunting and survive our local area animals :)))  p

 p In my opinion , it's a perfect for our world ))) We can save animals from extinction ))  In my country we don't have a rescue centres and have big problems with  animal injures ))) Some animals are dying on the streets .)))) So lets make our world safer and healthier )) We are humans and we can do this )))  p
