 p Wild hedgehogs are now in decline in some countries, so it’s a privilege to have one visiting your garden.  p 
 p How you can help a hedgehog visiting your garden:  p 
 p – Hedgehogs need a route in and out of your garden so that they can find food throughout the night. So, if you have a fence or wall then there should be a gap of about 12cm for the hedgehog to squeeze through.  p 
 p – Dedicate a corner of your garden to hedgehogs. Leave it wild with piles of leaves, dry wood, branches, logs. These are an attractive nest as well as a home for the invertebrates that hedgehogs like to eat. Wild garden areas give hedgehogs the chance to find shelter, bring up young and hibernate.  p 
 p – Provide them water and food: hedgehogs get hungry and can travel 1-2 km each night in search of food. Milk and bread can make hedgehogs sick, so stick to a dish of fresh water, meat-based cat dog food (but no fish),chopped unsalted peanuts, sunflower hearts, hedgehog food found in garden centres and pet shops.  p 
 p If there are hedgehogs around they will come to know where there is a reliable source of food. If you want to keep them around make sure you do this every day; you could supply a feeding station and maybe a house as well. If you’re lucky one may stay.  p
