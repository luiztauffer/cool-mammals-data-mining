 strong Non-commercial importation  strong 
  p 
 p The importation is considered to be non-commercial if the animal is yours and you do not intend to sell it or otherwise transfer it to another person. You must be travelling with the animal yourself.  p 
 p Here are two typical examples of non-commercial importation:  p 
 p You can also send the animal in the company of a person to whom you have given written permission to travel with the animal on your behalf. In that case, the animal may not be imported more than five days before or after your own journey to Norway.  p 
 p If these conditions are not fulfilled, the importation is considered to be commercial. Commercial imports are subject to different, more stringent provisions than those described here.  p

 strong Documentation of species and origin  strong 
  p 
 p The reptile must be accompanied by written documentation that shows the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and others that the animal belongs to one of the permitted species. The documentation must also show that the animal and its parents were born in captivity. The documententation must be signed by the seller.  p 
 p You must be prepared to produce the documentation to the Norwegian Food Safety Authority when you import the animal.  p 
 p The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has a form that everyone should complete to comply with the documentary requirements. The form is available  a class="mimeType_PDF" href="https:  www.mattilsynet.no language english animals travelling_with_pets travelling_to_norway_with_caged_birds_rodents_and_rabbits declaration_that_a_reptile_is_a_legal_species_and_that_the_reptile_and_the_reptiles_parents_have_been_born_in_captivity.28543 binary Declaration%20that%20a%20reptile%20is%20a%20legal%20species%20and%20that%20the%20reptile%20and%20the%20reptile%E2%80%99s%20parents%20have%20been%20born%20in%20captivity" here  a .  br You should fill in the form as fully as possible and attach a clear photo of the animal.  p 
 p In addition to the form, you should have a contract or certificate showing  p 
 p Also bring any other documents that show the species and the origin of the animal.  p

 strong Border crossing and control  strong 
  p 
 p You can import reptiles non-commercially from the EU member states, Andorra, Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Gibraltar, Greenland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican State through all border crossings into Norway that have manned customs points. You must go through the red lane and show the animal and documents to the Norwegian Customs Service. This applies to all reptiles, both with and without CITES permits.  p 
 p Non-commercial importation from other regions or countries is only permitted through Oslo Airport or Storskog in Sør-Varanger. Importation from Svalbard may also take place through Tromsø Airport, the Port of Tromsø or the Port of Bodø. The person travelling with the animal must contact the Norwegian Food Safety Authority at the point of entry and present the animal and necessary documentation for inspection. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority should be notified at least 48 hours before arrival to avoid a long wait before the inspection can be performed.  p
