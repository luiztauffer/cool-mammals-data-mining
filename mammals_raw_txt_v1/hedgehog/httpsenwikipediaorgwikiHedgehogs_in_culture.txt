(February 2013)" citation needed  span   a   i ]  sup . This partially results from the folk belief that hedgehogs collect apples and mushrooms and carry them to their secret storage.
  p 
 p It is unclear exactly how old this belief is, though the  a href=" wiki Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome" Roman  a  author  a href=" wiki Pliny_the_Elder" title="Pliny the Elder" Pliny the Elder  a  mentions hedgehogs gathering grapes by this method in his  i  a href=" wiki Naturalis_Historia" class="mw-redirect" title="Naturalis Historia" Naturalis Historia  a   i .  In medieval  a href=" wiki Bestiaries" class="mw-redirect" title="Bestiaries" bestiaries  a  and other illuminated manuscripts dating from at least the 13th century onwards, hedgehogs are shown rolling on and impaling fruit to carry back to their dens. In fact, however, hedgehogs do not gather food to store for later consumption, relying on their deposited fat to survive  a href=" wiki Hibernation" title="Hibernation" hibernation  a . Nor is apple included in their usual diet (it has been suggested, however, that the hedgehogs may use juice of wild apples in order to get rid of parasites, similar to  a href=" wiki Anting_(bird_activity)" title="Anting (bird activity)" anting  a ). The image remains an irresistible one to modern illustrators.  Therefore, hedgehogs are often portrayed carrying apples â€“ partially, to make them look cuter. sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;" [ i  a href=" wiki Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"  span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In reality, however, hedgehogs are lactose-intolerant.
  p 
 p Hedgehogs are also often seen in pictures with an autumn-themed background, since the animal  a href=" wiki Hibernation" title="Hibernation" hibernates  a  in piles of leaves. This also adds to the cute reputation of hedgehogs.  In Great Britain, however, the human habit of lighting  a href=" wiki Bonfires" class="mw-redirect" title="Bonfires" bonfires  a  to celebrate  a href=" wiki Guy_Fawkes_Night" title="Guy Fawkes Night" Bonfire Night  a  on 5 November has led to an increased risk to hedgehogs, who often choose to sleep in the piles of wood accumulated in gardens and parks beforehand.  Television messages now remind viewers who might be lighting bonfires to check them first for the presence of hibernating hedgehogs.
  p 
 p During the 1970s and 1980s, hedgehogs were one of the poster animals for environment activists through Europe. A lot of hedgehogs were killed by traffic, and since the hedgehog already had an aura of a cute little friendly animal, the choice was nearly perfect.

 p In a  a href=" wiki Vepsians" title="Vepsians" Veps  a  legend, the (female) hedgehog appears in a  a href=" wiki Creation_myth" title="Creation myth" creation myth  a . According to it, early on, there was no dry land; the entire world was just a big lake.

 p A hedgehog plays a role in a Lithuanian and Latvian creation story as well: when God made heaven and earth, he did not take good measurements, so the earth was made larger than the heaven; on the hedgehog's wise suggestion, God squeezed the earth, so that it would fit into the heaven. (In some version of the legend, the process of "shrinking" the earth resulted in the creation of mountain ranges). To reward the clever hedgehog, God equipped him with a suite of needles. sup id="cite_ref-civjan_1-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-civjan-1" [1]  a   sup

The hedgehog was the only one who failed to appear. The Sun went to look for the hedgehog, and found him gnawing on a stone. When the Sun inquired what he was doing, the hedgehog explained: "I am learning to eat stones. Once you marry, you'll have many  Sun children born to you, and when they all shine in the sky, everything will burn, and there will be nothing to eat". The Sun then decided to call off the wedding, and the world's inhabitants were saved from starvation. sup id="cite_ref-slavAnt2.Ezh_2-2" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-slavAnt2.Ezh-2" [2]  a   sup  sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-5" [5]  a   sup
