 p After  a target="_blank" href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 55726 20-fun-facts-about-our-mysterious-feline-friends" cats  a , hedgehogs might be the internet's favorite animal. But how much do you know about these spiky mammals—other than how cute they look when getting a bath?  p 
 p But it doesn't come up much, since hedgehogs are solitary creatures who usually  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 551081 collective-nouns-groups-animals" target="_self" come together  a  only to mate.  p 
 p The hedgie has gained some popularity as a pet—but some cities and states still  a target="_blank" href="http:  abcnews.go.com Lifestyle hedgehogs-spike-popularity-pets story?id=22652290" qualify them as wild animals  a , which are not allowed to be kept domestically. These include Arizona, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and New York City and Washington, D.C. In some areas, like Maine, you need permits in order to own one.  p 
 p Muscles along the animal's back can raise and lower the quills to respond to threatening situations.  p

 p The inside of the quills are mostly hollow, with a series of complex air chambers that make them light but strong.  p 
 p Their taste for destructive insects makes them a historically welcome presence in English gardens.  p 
 p Which makes  a href="https:  www.sttiggywinkles.org.uk top-navigation wildlife-advice hedgehog-fact-sheet.html" target="_blank" them  a  one of only three mammals in Great Britain that hibernate (the other two being bats and dormice).  p 
 p This means that, although their typical diet consists of insects and berries, they can take down a viper in a fight and eat it, too.  p 
 p Before the more adorable name came into use, the spiky mammals were called " a target="_blank" href="http:  britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk digitisedmanuscripts 2012 12 the-distinguished-pedigree-of-mrs-tiggy-winkle.html" urchins  a " throughout the Middle Ages, and thus inspired the name of the similarly spiky sea creatures. Baby hedgehogs are still called urchins.  p 
 p This is inaccurate. But affinity for the image has persisted.  p 
 p But when German  a href="http:  www.groundhog.org about history " target="_blank" settlers  a  got to America and found no hedgehogs, they turned to the similar-enough groundhog for their winter-weather predictions.  p

 p Perhaps there's a reason pigs are a favorite of children and fairy tales alike—pigs are some of the most  a href="https:  www.nytimes.com 2009 11 10 science 10angier.html" target="_blank" intelligent  a  and social animals out there. In honor of this year's designation as Year of the Pig on the Chinese zodiac calendar, here are a few facts you may not know about these curly-tailed  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 92686 15-fabulous-and-famous-internet-pigs" target="_self" cuties  a .  p 
 p Scientists  a href="https:  www.sciencemag.org news 2015 08 taming-pig-took-some-wild-turns" target="_blank" estimate  a  that pigs have been around for quite a long time. The omnivorous species is one of the oldest domesticated kinds of animals—behind only dogs and goats. Their wild ancestor is thought to be the Eurasian boar.  p 
 p Think of a classic image of a pig—odds are, it's rolling around in the mud. On hot days, pigs like to wallow in mud not because they're dirty, but to cool off. Pigs'  a href="https:  www.livescience.com 32118-do-pigs-sweat.html" target="_self" lack  a  sweat glands that would otherwise release body heat, and their high body fat necessitates they find ways to not fry in the sun. The muck allows them to maintain their proper body temperature while also having some leisurely, wallowing self-care.  p 
 p Considering how long swine has been around, the reach of the world's pig species spans across the globe. Every continent has  a href="https:  www.livescience.com 50623-pigs-facts.html" target="_blank" some population  a  of pigs, boars, and hogs, with Antarctica the only exception.  p 
 p Your typical piglet doesn't evoke any sense of danger, but feral pigs—and a growing number of  a href="https:  blogs.plos.org ecology 2017 02 01 invasive-wild-pigs-leave-a-swath-of-destruction-across-u-s-and-they-keep-spreading " target="_blank" invasive  a  pigs—are another story. Wild pigs cause an estimated  a href="http:  wildpiginfo.msstate.edu damage-caused-by-pigs.html" target="_blank" $1.5 billion  a  in damage annually in the United States; their rooting for food can  a href="https:  www.smithsonianmag.com science-nature a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069 " target="_blank" tear up  a  farmland, trample crops and recreational areas, and push out other wildlife. Plus, they can carry  a href="https:  www.aphis.usda.gov aphis ourfocus wildlifedamage operational-activities feral-swine feral-swine-resources" target="_blank" disease risks  a  that are more threatening to livestock and other domesticated animals, like dogs [ a href="https:  www.aphis.usda.gov publications wildlife_damage fs-disease-risk-dogs.pdf" target="_blank" PDF  a ]. Pigs may not be trampling over city buildings like Godzilla, but their impact on agricultural land is widespread and  a href="https:  www.cnbc.com 2018 08 03 hogs-run-wild-but-usda-doubling-efforts-to-fight-problem.html" target="_blank" significant  a .  p 
 p Denmark has a  a href="https:  theculturetrip.com europe denmark articles this-scandinavian-country-has-more-pigs-than-humans " target="_blank" larger population  a  of pigs than human beings. Part of this has to do with its lucrative  a href="https:  agricultureandfood.dk danish-agriculture-and-food danish-pig-meat-industry" target="_blank" meat industry  a , with over 5000 pig farms producing around 28 million pigs, with 20 million being slaughtered each year. In contrast, Denmark's human population is 5 to 6 million people. The pig population is so valuable, in fact, that the country  a href="https:  www.livescience.com 64617-denmark-builds-boar-border-wall.html" target="_blank" recently  a  began building a $12 million wall to prevent wild boars (who could possibly carry African swine fever, a viral disease which is highly contagious and deadly to both wild and domestic pigs, but not humans) in neighboring Germany from invading Danish pig farms.  p 
 p 
 a href="https:  www.all-creatures.org articles ar-pigscanplay.html" target="_blank" Research  a  at Penn State in the 1990s demonstrated that pigs, which are often perceived as being dirty and feeble-minded, have a remarkable aptitude for video games. The study showed that pigs are so smart that they were able to learn how to play a game involving a joystick better than chimpanzees and a Jack Russell terrier (a breed often used in movies because it is known for its intelligence and trainability).  p 
 p Wilbur, the main character in E.B. White’s timeless children's tale  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 67639 10-things-you-might-not-know-about-charlottes-web" target="_self"  em Charlotte's Web  em   a , is likely literature's most beloved pig. The 2006 movie adaptation of the same name seemingly knew as such and used  a href="https:  www.thedodo.com pigs-who-starred-in-charlottes-web-ended-up-at-this-sanctuary-2024537619.html" target="_blank" 46 piglets  a  to accurately portray the character on the big screen. Each and every one of the piglets was treated like Hollywood royalty: After filming wrapped, they were looked after and given new homes in Australia (where the film was shot). And, another pig from the movie also got a happy ending—the sow who played Wilbur's mother, who was later named  a href="https:  www.edgarsmission.org.au animals alice " target="_blank" Alice  a , went to live at an animal sanctuary with two of the piglets. Squeal!  p 
 p Winston Churchill is best remembered for his leadership as the prime minister of the United Kingdom during World War II. It's somewhat of a shame that, lost in his sea of memorable speeches and quotes, his wise view on pigs went a bit unnoticed. "I am fond of pigs,"  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 26816 5-things-you-didnt-know-about-winston-churchill" target="_self" Churchill  a  once  a href="https:  books.google.com books?id=q2hsDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT229&amp;dq=%22I+am+fond+of+pigs,%22+Churchill&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI_urRxevgAhWiSt8KHTDHDwYQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20am%20fond%20of%20pigs%2C%22%20Churchill&amp;f=false" target="_blank" said  a . "Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals." In other words, dogs seek our approval, cats couldn't care less, but pigs, who are intelligent and sociable, are on more equal-footing with humans.  p

 p Kermit the Frog may have his  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 63794 20-facts-about-muppets-featuring-muppets" target="_self" own star  a  on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but his romantic interest, Miss Piggy, is an icon in her own right. But before the diva was fully realized, she went by a slightly different name. According to handwritten  a href="http:  time.com 2918157 miss-piggy-muppets-piggy-lee " target="_blank" notes  a  and Polaroids from  em Muppets  em  creator Jim Henson, Miss Piggy was originally named Piggy Lee, a reference to famed jazz singer Peggy Lee.  p 
 p "When I first created Miss Piggy I called her Miss Piggy Lee—as both a joke and an homage," Muppet designer Bonnie Erickson told  a href="https:  www.smithsonianmag.com arts-culture the-woman-behind-miss-piggy-11290861 " target="_blank"  em Smithsonian  em   a  in 2008. "Peggy Lee was a very independent woman, and Piggy certainly is the same." But, like many a starlet destined for the limelight, Piggy Lee needed her name to be more original. And also, "as Piggy's fame began to grow, nobody wanted to upset Peggy Lee," Erickson added, "especially because we admired her work."  p 
 p As a kid, you saved all your spare change in one particular safekeeping storage item: the piggy bank. But of all the animals in the world, why did the pig get all of the glory?  p 
 p In the 13th to 15th centuries, one of the most common places for people to store their money was in jars made of orange-colored clay called " a href="https:  thefinancialbrand.com 24204 history-of-piggy-banks " target="_blank" pygg  a ." As the English language evolved, that word eventually became  em pig  em  or  em piggy  em . Whether by accident or design, around the 19th century manufacturers began molding little pots into the shape of pigs, and eventually piggy banks were all the rage. So next time you bring home a little extra bacon, you know where to put it.  p 
 p In the mid-17th century, a creature of curious proportions was  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 58331 22-brilliant-old-nicknames-animals" target="_self" caught  a  in Virginia and brought to the Royal Society in London for observation. The furry animal had a pointed snout, sharp teeth, and, most remarkably, a pouch in its belly. Unsure how else to describe it, those who saw it described it a cross between a fox and an ape.  p 
 p This bizarre animal turned out to be the only marsupial native to the U.S. and Canada. Now, we know them as  em  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 544902 facts-about-opossums" target="_self" opossums  a   em —derived from the  a href="http:  mentalfloss.com article 563419 native-american-names-used-in-english" target="_self" Algonquian  a  word  a href="https:  www.dictionary.com e possum-opossum " target="_blank"  em aposoum  em   a , meaning “white dog” or “white beast." (Despite the vicious-sounding nomenclature, opossums are rarely dangerous. They’re actually a boon to gardeners because they  a href="https:  citywildlife.org the-truth-about-opossums " target="_blank" eat pests  a  like beetles and slugs, and also help control tick populations.)  p 
 p So where do  em possums  em  fit into this narrative? You may occasionally refer to the pink-nosed animal trotting along the road as a  em possum  em , which is an acceptable truncated version of  em opossum  em . However, the word without the  em o  em  refers to something very different outside of North America.  p 
 p While  em possum  em  is sometimes a synonym of  em opossum  em , it can also refer to a completely different species that lives in New Guinea, Australia, Indonesia, and elsewhere in the Pacific. Though possums and opossums have a lot in common—including the fact that they’re nocturnal, omnivorous, tree-dwelling marsupials that are known to play dead, or “play possum,” when threatened—they look quite different. Here’s what an Australian brushtail possum looks like (while the above photo is the more familiar opossum):  p 
 p As for the pronunciation, it’s a common misconception that the first  em o  em  in  em opossum  em  is silent.  a href="https:  www.merriam-webster.com dictionary opossum" target="_blank" Merriam-Webster  a ,  a href="https:  www.grammarly.com blog opossum-vs-possum " target="_blank" Grammarly  a , and  a href="https:  www.dictionary.com browse opossum" target="_blank" Dictionary.com  a  all note that the word is pronounced  em uh-possum  em , with the first vowel voiced. However, if you’re opting for the shortened version,  em possum  em , then it’s fine to omit the  em o  em  sound. Unless you’re speaking with an Australian, it’s likely you’ll be understood either way.  p
