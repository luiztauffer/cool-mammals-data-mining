 p In October 2013, with Ninna growing nicely, the doctor found an underweight male hedgehog in his garden. The problem with hedgehogs weighing less than 600 grams (1.3 pounds) just before winter is that they won’t survive hibernation. They need the extra fat during this prolonged period without food. Plus there is the physiological stress they undergo: their heartbeat decreases from 200 beats per minute to 10, and from 40 to one breath per minute. In fact, one-third of all hedgehogs die during hibernation, Vacchetta explained. So he took in the young male and called him Ninno. span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-116" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"   span  span style="display:block !important;float:none;margin-bottom:10px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:10px !important;min-height:60px;min-width:468px;text-align:center !important;" class="ezoic-ad box-3 adtester-container adtester-container-116" data-ez-name="perceptivetravel_com-box-3"  span id="div-gpt-ad-perceptivetravel_com-box-3-0" ezaw="468" ezah="60" style="position:relative;z-index:0;display:inline-block;min-height:60px;min-width:468px;" class="ezoic-ad"  script data-cfasync="false" type="text javascript" style="display:none;" eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'perceptivetravel_com-box-3','ezslot_6',116,'0']));  script   span   span   p 
 p A few months later the doctor found a half-dead hedgehog by the side of the road. By the time he had nursed Trilli back to health, the idea of a center for injured and orphaned hedgehogs had taken shape in his mind. He obtained the required permits and opened the center, named for Ninna, in June 2014.   p 
 p By January 2018, the center had hosted 400 hedgehogs and has re-released most them back into the wild—including Dr. Vacchetta’s beloved Ninna. During my visit, 80 hedgehogs were hibernating in Novello. Fifty of these will be released in April, provided they are of proper weight, age, and health.   p 
 p  em Where  em  they are released is the result of careful study. Dr. Vacchetta purchased a 20-hectare property about 30 miles from Novello, which he calls Paradise, meaning a paradise for hedgehogs…and not only. It has lush green forests, waterfalls, and ponds (hedgehogs love water), and of course hedges. It lacks aggressive dogs, busy roads, agricultural fields (and the equipment used to work them), and swimming pools. Hedgehogs can swim, explains the vet, but there is no way for them to get out of a swimming pool. He hopes eventually to enlarge this natural enclave for the benefit of more hedgehogs and other indigenous wildlife.   p

 p Another dream, much closer to realization, is a fully-equipped hospital for hedgehogs on the ground floor of the center. That will be operational this year and will be especially helpful for permanent guests—animals too handicapped to survive on their own. Like Musetta, or Pipino, who can’t urinate properly without manual assistance. Or Ditina, born without rear legs. Or Zoe, blind in one eye and with a mutilated leg.  p 
 p As a visitor, I saw some of these residents. Hibernation isn’t full-on for all the hedgehogs at La Ninna. Some curl up in their little houses of cardboard or wood, lovingly constructed by Dr. Vacchetta and a small army of volunteers. Others move about in their enclosures, also during the day. They may require feeding, treatment, or weighing.  p 
 p Then there are the complications of global warming. As Dr. Vacchetta explains, “When the temperature in January goes above 10 degrees C (52 degrees F), the hedgehogs wake up. This is a problem because they expend far more energy waking than sleeping. So these spells of warming mean that the animal must be heavier than it had to be even 10 years ago to survive a winter.” span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-118" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"   span  span style="display:block !important;float:none;margin-bottom:10px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:10px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;" class="ezoic-ad medrectangle-4 adtester-container adtester-container-118" data-ez-name="perceptivetravel_com-medrectangle-4"  span id="div-gpt-ad-perceptivetravel_com-medrectangle-4-0" ezaw="250" ezah="250" style="position:relative;z-index:0;display:inline-block;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;" class="ezoic-ad"  script data-cfasync="false" type="text javascript" style="display:none;" eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'perceptivetravel_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',118,'0']));  script   span   span   p 
 p Global warming has also been responsible for a second arrival of offspring in September. These babies are unlucky because they don’t have a full season to prepare for hibernation, and insects in September are already scarce. So almost 90 percent of these hedgehoglets die.  p 
 p Survivors of the winter acclimate in one of the center’s outdoor enclosures in the early spring. Visitors during this period should see more activity. However, hedgehogs are nocturnal animals so don’t expect Sonic the Hedgehog hustling, regardless of the season. span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-119" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"   span  span style="display:block !important;float:none;margin-bottom:10px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:10px !important;min-height:280px;min-width:336px;text-align:center !important;" class="ezoic-ad box-4 adtester-container adtester-container-119" data-ez-name="perceptivetravel_com-box-4"  span id="div-gpt-ad-perceptivetravel_com-box-4-0" ezaw="336" ezah="280" style="position:relative;z-index:0;display:inline-block;min-height:280px;min-width:336px;" class="ezoic-ad"  script data-cfasync="false" type="text javascript" style="display:none;" eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'perceptivetravel_com-box-4','ezslot_5',119,'0']));  script   span   span   p 
 p I learned more about hedgehogs through my conversation with Dr. Vacchetta (yes, he speaks reasonable English) than through my observation of his guests, however adorable the latter may be. I was not allowed to touch the residents, since this would stress them and create an obstacle to liberation. But I did get very up close and personal. An added bonus: he is the co-author of a best-selling book about Ninna and the birth of the center.  em 25 grammi di felicità (A handful of happiness)  em  has been published in more than 60 countries and dozens of languages, including English. Sales from the book and donations from the center’s  a href="  www.lacasadeiricci.org 2016 " target="new" website  a  and  a href="https:  www.facebook.com centrorecuperoricciLaNinna " target="new" Facebook page  a  are the only ongoing sources of funding for La Ninna. The regional government of Piedmont is supposed to provide funds, as hedgehogs are technically property of the state, but it has not done so. Bureaucracy trumps policy.  p
