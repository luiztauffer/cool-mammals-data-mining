With their strange long noses and rounded heads, as well as their shy nature, these dolphins are far from any Flipper clichés, and are an amazingly beautiful addition to any visit to the  a href="https:  theculturetrip.com south-america colombia articles a-locals-guide-to-colombias-amazon-rainforest " Colombian Amazon  a . They can be seen throughout the Amazonia and Orinoquia regions of Colombia, making a trip to see – and swim with – pink river dolphins an essential part of any tour in the region.  p

They are extremely rare, but luckily for wildlife enthusiasts, a small population was introduced in  a href="https:  theculturetrip.com south-america colombia articles the-ultimate-guide-to-tayrona-national-park " Tayrona National Park  a  in a successful attempt to preserve the species. With their curious nature and tuft of bright-white fur, cotton-top tamarins are a memorable part of a visit to Tayrona and are, gratifyingly, relatively easy to spot on the forest trails of the park at dawn and dusk.  p

They are also critically endangered, having been mercilessly hunted for their skins in the 19th and 20th centuries. Seeing an Orinoco crocodile in the wild is extremely unlikely, and only really possible in the isolated Tuparro National park on the Venezuelan border. However, luckily for all budding herpetologists, there is a thriving Orinoco crocodile breeding and reintroduction programme at Wisirare Park in the eastern plains of Casanare department, where visitors can get up close and personal with some of the 17 feet (5.18 meter) giants.  p

The weirdest and most wonderful though is Diaethria phlogea, a native species also known as the 89’98 butterfly due to the distinct number patterns on its outer wings.  p

They are threatened, and extremely hard to observe in the wild on account of their nocturnal habits and shyness, but they are also surprisingly widespread in Colombia, even occurring in popular tourist spots like Tayrona National Park. The best place to seek out a jaguar is La Aurora Ecolodge in the plains of Casanare department, where guests can join late-night drives to inspect camera traps set up to monitor jaguar populations.  p

Although they are not unique to Colombia, occurring in all South American countries except Chile, seeing wild capybaras is an unmissable experience for wildlife enthusiasts visiting Colombia, simply for their bizarre appearance and extreme size, like a giant guinea pig. They are widespread in the Eastern Plains of Colombia – where they are also considered a real delicacy – and especially easy to see in the dry season when vast family groups of up to 100 individuals gather around watering holes.  p

But these aren’t just any frogs: Colombia is home to some of the most colourful and poisonous frogs on the planet. Known colloquially as poison dart frogs or arrow frogs, due to indigenous peoples once using their venom as a weapon during hunting, there are many different species unique to Colombia. The most spectacular species is the bright yellow golden poison frog: the most venomous vertebrate in the world, and endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia.  p

The only surviving species of bear native to South America, it is extremely hard to spot a spectacled bear in the wild, but the best place to do so is the vast moorlands of Chingaza National Park, just outside Bogotá. They are still highly threatened by poaching and habitat destruction but are considered one of Colombia’s most important native species.  p

There is nothing quite like seeing an adult Andean condor in flight, soaring above the mighty peaks of the Andes, and the best place to observe these magnificent birds in the wild in Colombia are the Cocora Valley, Puracé National Park, and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.  p

Found roaming the wide-open plains of the Colombia’s eastern departments, these anteaters – also known locally as ant bears – can measure up to 7 feet (2.13 meters) in length, and weigh almost 100lbs (45.4 kg). They feed primarily on termites and ants, using their massive claws and long, sticky tongues to eat thousands of the insects every day.  p

The humpbacks arrive in the region in large numbers in June and stay until around October, taking advantage of the lack of predators in the warm tropical waters to give birth and teach their young calves. They are easily seen in these months from small boats departing from small towns in the sparsely populated Chocó department: Nuqui and Bahia Solano are the best spots to visit.  p
