They are about two feet tall and four feet long, and can weigh up to 150 pounds. They eat aquatic plant matter, fruit and vegetables.  p 
 p Capybara seem to waddle a little bit while walking because they have webbed feet for swimming. Because of their love for the water, South American locals refer to capybara as the “water pig”. Capybara can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes and will actually breed while submerged. A female will give birth to between two and nine young.  p
