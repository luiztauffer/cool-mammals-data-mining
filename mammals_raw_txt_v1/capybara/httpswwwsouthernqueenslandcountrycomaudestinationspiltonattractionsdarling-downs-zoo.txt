The Zoo is also home to the only White Lions living permanently in Queensland and the largest herd of Zebras and Giant Tortoises in this State!  br  br The zoo is open to the public from 9am every day.  Closed only on Christmas Day. br  br Picnic facilities are available, there is a kiosk and gift shop with EFTPOS and free parking for all vehicles including coaches and caravans.
