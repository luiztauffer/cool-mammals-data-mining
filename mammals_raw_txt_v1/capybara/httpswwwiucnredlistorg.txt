 p Established in 1964,  strong The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species  strong  has evolved to become the world’s most comprehensive information source on the global conservation status of animal, fungi and plant species.  p 
 p The IUCN Red List is a critical indicator of the health of the world’s biodiversity. Far more than a list of species and their status, it is a powerful tool to inform and catalyze action for biodiversity conservation and policy change, critical to protecting the natural resources we need to survive. It provides information about range, population size, habitat and ecology, use and or trade, threats, and conservation actions that will help inform necessary conservation decisions.  p

The IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria are intended to be an easily and widely understood system for classifying species at high risk of global extinction. It divides species into nine categories:
 strong Not Evaluated  strong ,
 strong Data Deficient  strong ,
 strong Least Concern  strong ,
 strong Near Threatened  strong ,
 strong Vulnerable  strong ,
 strong Endangered  strong ,
 strong Critically Endangered  strong ,
 strong Extinct in the Wild  strong 
and
 strong Extinct  strong .
  p 
 p 
A taxon is
 strong Data Deficient (DD)  strong 
when there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of its risk of extinction based on its distribution and or population status. A taxon in this category may be well studied, and its biology well known, but appropriate data on abundance and or distribution are lacking.

 strong Least Concern (LC)  strong

 strong Critically Endangered  strong ,
 strong Endangered  strong ,
 strong Vulnerable  strong

 strong Near Threatened  strong .
  p

A taxon is
 strong Near Threatened (NT)  strong 
when it has been evaluated against the criteria but does not qualify for

when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable, and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.

 p 
A taxon is
 strong Extinct In The Wild (EW)  strong 
when it is known only to survive in cultivation, in captivity or as a naturalized population (or populations) well outside the past range. A taxon is presumed Extinct in the Wild when exhaustive surveys in known and or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.

A taxon is presumed Extinct when exhaustive surveys in known and or expected habitat, at appropriate times (diurnal, seasonal, annual), throughout its historic range have failed to record an individual. Surveys should be over a time frame appropriate to the taxon's life cycle and life form.

 p class="section__body__lede" To date, more than 96,900 species have been assessed for The IUCN Red List.  p 
 p This is an incredible achievement. However, our work is nowhere near complete. We need to more than double the number of wild species (plants, animals and fungi) assessed  p 
 p Our new goal is 160,000 species by 2020. Meeting this goal will provide the most up-to-date indication of the health of the world’s biodiversity to guide critical conservation action. This is only achievable with support from people like you.  p
