 p The BC SPCA is very concerned about the welfare of all exotic animals in captivity, though there are many reasons  a href=" ways-to-help take-action exotic-pets " why exotic animals make bad pets  a . Some dangerous exotic animals are illegal to keep as pets in B.C.  p

 p B.C. has some of the most restrictive legislation and regulations in the country on the private keeping of exotic animals. Those that pose the most risk to public health and safety have been designated as Controlled Alien Species under provincial legislation after high-profile human injuries and death.  p

Wildlife Act’s Controlled Alien Species (CAS) Regulation  a  controls the possession, breeding, shipping and releasing of certain exotic animals (wild animals not native to B.C.). As the provincial government has the responsibility of ensuring public safety, the exotic animals listed in the regulation reflect only those who pose a serious risk to human health or safety.  p 
 p Those  a href="http:  www.env.gov.bc.ca fw wildlifeactreview cas species.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" exotic animals on the CAS list  a  living in B.C. before 2009 may have been allowed to stay in the province under specific permit conditions, but no new animals could be imported or bred after the new law was enacted. Accredited zoos, research institutions, film companies and rescue centres must be permitted to keep any CAS species.  p

 p Pets like serval cats, iguanas and parrots continue to suffer in captivity because they were not included in the provincial regulations. Municipal bylaws can be effective at preventing additional exotic animals from being kept as pets or used in entertainment.  p 
 p As trends in exotic pet ownership change, every year new species of exotic animals are legally brought into the province, sold, bred and sometimes displayed publically in communities. To ensure municipalities are safeguarded and animal welfare is protected, we recommend the use of a “positive list” of animals who can be kept as pets over a list of prohibited species which needs to be regularly amended (often referred to as a “negative list”).  p 
 p There are a number of benefits to positive lists, including:  p
