 p class="partial_entry"  span class="fullText " We had booked a capybara experience. The keeper was extremely knowledgeable and it was clear he loved his job and cares for all of the animals across the park. The experience itself was brilliant. Couldn't have asked for anything better. There is a wide range of animals in the park, all of which are clearly well cared for and looked after. The staff are friendly and welcoming. They seem to be constantly improving and adding to the park and so we will definitely be returning again. Wonderful experience!   span   p 
 p class="partial_entry" Didn't even know this place existed! Lovely day out with my sister in law. Great selection of animals all very well looked after. This park has a lot of potential, fingers crossed it keeps expanding and improving. br  br We had lunch in the cafe which was disorganised to say the least. Didn't seem to know what each other was doing. br  br Overall good trip!  p 
 p class="partial_entry" Lots of variety. Animals mainly seemed v well cared for although mini beasts appeared to b in v small accommodation.  8 yr old god son loved it.   p 
 p class="partial_entry" First time we have visited this but have passed it many times staff are friendly and helpful and there is a surprising amount to see especially tha small tractor museum lot of items from my childhood!  br The small cafe is also a pleasant surprise from the usual attraction food it was good food at a very reasonable cost I can thourghly recommend a visit here.  p 
 p class="partial_entry" Nice little zoo advisable to wear decent shoes as terrain uneven . Young children it is great for . Small cafe well organized . Good play area for kids x  p 
 p class="partial_entry" Emailed ahead to ask if it was wheelchair friendly and was told most of the paths were concrete   tarmac but certain areas were not accessible. Arrived after a 45 min drive and paid entrance to then be told the cafe was closed due to an electricity problem but would hopefully be open later. Struggled to get the wheelchair around any of the paths as there was no real concrete apart from one small strip which in itself was uneven. Mainly loose gravel   stone paths which were not wheelchair friendly at all. Not loads to see or do for older children, came away after struggling with the wheelchair for 2 hours. The Lemurs were the highlight. However, all the animals appeared to be very well cared for. Probably more ideal for smaller children.  p
