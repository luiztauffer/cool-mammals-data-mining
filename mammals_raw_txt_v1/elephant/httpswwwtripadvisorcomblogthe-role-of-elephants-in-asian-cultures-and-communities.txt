 p Many Asian cultures have been living and working with elephants for centuries. The first reports of elephant domestication were in the Indus Valley civilization in South Asia as early as 2500 BC[1]. Due to their high intelligence, elephants have been able to develop a unique relationship with humans, leading to their use as working animals aiding in tasks such as logging, transportation, and warfare[2]. As such, throughout Asian art and culture, elephants have come to serve as a source of admiration, symbolizing positive attributes including strength and power, royalty, intelligence, longevity, luck and fortune[3],[4].  p 
 p Today, as wildlife tourism is worth up to 25 percent of the trillion-dollar global tourism industry, communities throughout Asia have a monetary incentive to use elephants for income generation. a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" [5]  a   There are currently 13 Asian elephant range countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam) in which elephants often serve as a leading tourist attraction. a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" [6]  a  sup , a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" [7]  a   sup  In these countries, elephants are taught to do activities including performing tricks, painting pictures, providing recreational rides as well as posing for photos.  p 
 p Mahouts – otherwise known as elephant trainers or keepers – traditionally have served as the primary caretakers for elephants, known for forming a special bond with one in particular. a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" [8]  a  Once regarded as a prestigious profession based on knowledge passed down from generation-to-generation, mahouts today are primarily poorly paid marginalized people – often Burmese migrants – making as little as $90 a month if they do not own their own elephants. a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" [9]  a  These migrant workers, employed by elephant camp owners, often receive little training to perform a job that can be dangerous. a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" [10]  a   p 
 p Today, several wealthy families own the majority of elephants in Asia, and in turn also employ the mahouts and run the elephant camps. a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" [11]  a  Only a small percentage of mahouts and communities still have ownership over their own elephants, and those that do often rent the elephants out to camps during the day to generate the funds necessary for feed and veterinary bills. a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" [12]  a  sup , a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" [13]  a   sup  In some cases, an entire village owns several elephants and shares the money they make from the rentals. a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" [14]  a   p 
 p This wildlife tourism ultimately provides the economic means necessary to maintain the elephants’ quality of life. As elephants require 260-440 lbs of food and at least 200L of water per day (for drinking and bathing), tourist attractions help generate the income needed to provide them with adequate care, food, water, and shelter. a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" [15]  a  Elephants have long been an important and valued part of Asian civilization and therefore, it is vital that attraction operators ensure they are providing the proper care for captive elephants. When elephant attractions are properly managed – taking both the animal’s and the community’s well-being into consideration – they can end up generating positive awareness for just how extraordinary and smart elephants are.  p
