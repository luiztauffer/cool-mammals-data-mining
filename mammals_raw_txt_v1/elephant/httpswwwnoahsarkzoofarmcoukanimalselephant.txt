 p  strong Characteristics  strong   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The African elephant is bigger than its Asian cousin and is actually the largest animal walking on earth. Present in 37 African countries, they are majestic creatures, easily distinguished by their large ears and trunk.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The African elephant has two family members – the savanna (or bush) elephant and the forest elephant. The savanna elephant lives in the open plains of Africa, whilst the forest elephant lives in the huge rainforests of Africa.  span   p 
 p  span style="color: #000000;" The elephant’s great ears help to cool the animal as they circulate blood through a large surface area, helping transfer heat energy away. Elephants also cool themselves down by spraying water over themselves with their trunk and through covering themselves in mud. The mud keeps them cool, stops them from burning in the sun and prevents insect bites.  span   p
