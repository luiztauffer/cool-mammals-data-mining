 p Riding an elephant is one of the most popular tourist activities in Asia. Our new damning report, reveals that more than three quarters of nearly  strong 3,000 elephants  strong  used for tourist entertainment in Asia are kept in severely-cruel conditions.  p 
 p We investigated conditions endured by  strong 2,923 elephants  strong  at tourist venues in Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Laos and Cambodia, and found that  strong 77%   strong of them were treated appallingly.  p

 p We’re urging supporters to unite for the herd to protect elephants. You can  a href="http:  unitefortheherd.org us" style="font-size: inherit;" target="_blank" read the online report, and share it  a  with friends and family to inspire them to make better choices for elephants while on holiday.  p 
 p Conditions in Thailand proved most concerning, with almost twice the number of elephants used for tourism there than all the other Asian countries combined.  p 
 p Tourism to Thailand doubled from  strong 15.9 million to 32.6 million  strong  visitors between 2010 and 2016, contributing to a  strong 30% increase  strong  (1,688 to 2,198) in elephants held in captivity for tourist activities.  p 
 p Our new research also found that several venues in Thailand cater to thousands of visitors daily, generating estimated profits of tens of thousands of dollars per month from exploiting Asian elephants – an endangered species.  p 
 p When not giving rides or performing, elephants at tourist attractions are typically kept chained day and night. Most of the time the chains measure  strong less than 10 feet  strong .  p 
 p These majestic, wild animals are also fed poor diets and receive limited veterinary care. They are frequently kept on concrete floors in stressful locations near loud music, roads, or noisy visitor groups.  p 
 p "The cruel trend of elephants used for rides and shows is growing. We want tourists to know that many of these elephants are taken from their mothers as babies, forced to endure harsh training and suffer poor living conditions throughout their life."  p 
 p "There is an urgent need for tourist education and regulation of wildlife tourist attractions worldwide. Venues that offer tourists a chance to watch elephants in genuine sanctuaries are beacons of hope that can encourage the urgently-needed shift in the captive elephant tourism industry," said Dr Jan Schmidt-Burbach, our global wildlife and veterinary advisor.  p 
 p Our study on tourist attitudes in 2017 revealed a  strong 9% drop  strong  in the number of people who find elephant riding acceptable, compared to three years ago.  p 
 p In 2014, we revealed that  strong 53%  strong  of people surveyed at the time felt that riding an elephant was acceptable, compared to only  strong 44%  strong  in 2017.  p 
 p Most tourists sign up for experiences with elephants because they love wild animals and don’t know about the cruelty behind the rides, tricks and photo opportunities. If people knew the facts, then they wouldn’t participate in cruel elephant activities.  p 
 p The best place to see an elephant is in the wild or, at a genuine elephant sanctuary. To find out more,  a href="http:  unitefortheherd.org us" target="_blank" read our new Taken for a ride report  a .  p
