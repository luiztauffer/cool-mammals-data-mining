 p  strong 4202.  strong   em Congressional   em  The Congress finds the following:  br 
            
              (1) Elephant populations in Africa have declined at an alarming rate since   the mid-1970's.
        p 
 p (2)  The large illegal trade in African elephant ivory is the major cause of  this decline and threatens the continued existence of the African  elephant.   p 
 p (3) The African elephant is listed as  threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et  seq.) and its continued existence will be further jeopardized if this  decline is not reversed.   p 
 p (4) Because African elephant  ivory is indistinguishable from Asian elephant ivory, there is a need  to ensure the trade in African elephant ivory does not further endanger  the Asian elephant, which is listed as endangered under section 4 of  the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) and under Appendix  I of CITES.   p 
 p (5) In response to the significant  illegal trade in African elephant ivory, the parties to CITES  established the CITES Ivory Control System to curtail the illegal trade  and to encourage African countries to manage, conserve, and protect  their African elephant populations.   p 
 p (6) The CITES  Ivory Control System entered into force recently and should be allowed  to continue in force for a reasonable period of time to assess its  effectiveness in curtailing the illegal trade in African elephant  ivory.   p 
 p (7) Although some African countries have  effective African elephant conservation programs, many do not have  sufficient resources to properly manage, conserve, and protect their  elephant populations.   p 
 p (8) The United States, as a  party to CITES and a large market for worked ivory, shares  responsibility for supporting and implementing measures to stop the  illegal trade in African elephant ivory and to provide for the  conservation of the African elephant.   p 
 p (9) There is no  evidence that sport hunting is part of the poaching that contributes to  the illegal trade in African elephant ivory, and there is evidence that  the proper utilization of well-managed elephant populations provides an  important source of funding for African elephant conservation programs.   p
