 p The distinctive trunk is an elongation of the nose and upper lip combined; the nostrils are at its tip, which has a one finger-like process. The trunk contains as many as 60,000 muscles, which consist of longitudinal and radiating sets. The longitudinals are mostly superficial and subdivided into anterior, lateral, and posterior. The deeper muscles are best seen as numerous distinct  a href=" wiki Muscle_fascicle" title="Muscle fascicle" fasciculi  a  in a cross-section of the trunk. The trunk is a multipurpose prehensile organ and highly sensitive, innervated by the  a href=" wiki Maxillary_nerve" title="Maxillary nerve" maxillary division  a  of the  a href=" wiki Trigeminal_nerve" title="Trigeminal nerve" trigeminal nerve  a  and by the  a href=" wiki Facial_nerve" title="Facial nerve" facial nerve  a . The acute sense of smell uses both the trunk and  a href=" wiki Jacobson%27s_organ" class="mw-redirect" title="Jacobson's organ" Jacobson's organ  a . Elephants use their trunks for breathing, watering, feeding, touching, dusting, sound production and communication, washing, pinching, grasping, defense and offense. sup id="cite_ref-Shoshani82_4-4" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Shoshani82-4" [4]  a   sup

 p The " a href=" wiki Proboscis" title="Proboscis" proboscis  a " or trunk consists wholly of muscular and  a href=" wiki Membranous_tissue" class="mw-redirect" title="Membranous tissue" membranous tissue  a , and is a tapering muscular structure of nearly circular cross-section extending proximally from attachment at the anterior nasal orifice, and ending distally in a tip or finger. The length may vary from 1.5 to 2 m (59 to 79 in) or longer depending on the species and age. Four basic muscle masses—the radial, the longitudinal and two oblique layers—and the size and attachments points of the  a href=" wiki Tendon" title="Tendon" tendon  a  masses allow the shortening, extension, bending, and twisting movements accounting for the ability to hold, and manipulate loads of up to 300 kg (660 lb). Muscular and tendinous ability combined with nervous control allows extraordinary strength and agility movements of the trunk, such as sucking and spraying of water or dust and directed air flow blowing. sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-20" [20]  a   sup

 p  a href=" wiki Elephant_tusk" class="mw-redirect" title="Elephant tusk" Tusks  a  serve to dig for water, salt, and rocks, to debark and uproot trees, as levers for maneuvering fallen trees and branches, for work, for display, for  a href=" wiki Territorial_marking" class="mw-redirect" title="Territorial marking" marking trees  a , as weapon for offense and defense, as trunk-rests, and as protection for the trunk.

 p Female Asian elephants usually lack  a href=" wiki Tusk" title="Tusk" tusks  a ; if tusks—in that case called "tushes"—are present, they are barely visible, and only seen when the mouth is open. The  a href=" wiki Tooth_enamel" title="Tooth enamel" enamel plates  a  of the  a href=" wiki Molars" class="mw-redirect" title="Molars" molars  a  are greater in number and closer together in Asian elephants. Some males may also lack tusks; these individuals are called "filsy makhnas", and are especially common among the Sri Lankan elephant population. Furthermore, the forehead has two hemispherical bulges, unlike the flat front of the African elephant. Unlike African elephants which rarely use their forefeet for anything other than digging or scraping soil, Asian elephants are more agile at using their feet in conjunction with the trunk for manipulating objects. They can sometimes be known for their violent behaviour. sup id="cite_ref-Clutton-Brock_22-0" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-Clutton-Brock-22" [22]  a   sup

However, solitary  a href=" wiki Rogue_elephant#Elephant_rage" class="mw-redirect" title="Rogue elephant" rogues  a  are frequently an exception to this rule, and sometimes make unprovoked attacks on passers-by. Rogue elephants sometimes take up a position near a road, making it impassable to travellers. Females with calves are at all times dangerous to approach. When an Asian elephant makes a charge, it tightly curls up its trunk and attacks by trampling its victim with feet or knees, or, if a male, by pinning it to the ground with its tusks. During  a href=" wiki Musth" title="Musth" musth  a , bulls are highly dangerous, not only to human beings, but also to other animals. At the first indications, trained elephants are secured tightly to prevent any mishaps. There is also one case of a rogue elephant having actually consumed a human, an attack merited to be extremely unnatural. The elephant, a rogue female, had previously lost her calf to an accident involving farmers. This grievous loss led the elephant to target humans first as a threat, and then as a food source as her mental state deteriorated until she was finally killed and later dissected, revealing through DNA analysis that she had indeed consumed human flesh. The incident was revealed to the general public in several articles and in the Animal Planet documentary "World's Deadliest Towns: Man-Eating Elephant". sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"  a href="#cite_note-50" [50]  a   sup
