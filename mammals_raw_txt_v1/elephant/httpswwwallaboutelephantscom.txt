 p  em Two Tails Ranch  em  was founded in 1984 by Theodore H. Svertesky (1954-1994) and Patricia L. Zerbini. The ranch is the only privately owned elephant facility of its kind. The natural coast of Florida is a prime location for elephants. The climate is almost identical to their native countries. The location of our ranch is surrounded by green grass, live oaks and natural wildlife. It is a very peaceful environment that both animals and guests can enjoy. The ranch was built to board both Asian and African elephants needing temporary or permanent housing, regardless of health or dispositions. Over 250 elephants have passed through the gates of the ranch for a variety of reasons. Some stayed temporarily while their own exhibits were being remodeled or built. Others stayed for retirement, medical needs, behavior problems or even in emergencies after hurricanes destroyed their zoos.  br  br In 2008 Patricia Zerbini decided to start educational programs for private sectors and professionals to learn about elephants. As a result,  em All About Elephants, Inc.  em  was created. br  br In private guided tours you will learn and interact with elephants like nowhere else. Our ranch is also home to our Grant Zebras Piere and Tache, African Spurthighed Tortoises Bert And Ernie, Red Foot Tortoises Daisy and Rosy, Ostrich Katherine, Emu Peepers, Camel Louis.  p
