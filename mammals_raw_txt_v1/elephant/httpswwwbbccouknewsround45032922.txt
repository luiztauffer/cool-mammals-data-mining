 p class="newsround-story-body__text" role="introduction" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$1" When you think about the animals you'd love to see in the wild, elephants would probably be top of most of our lists.    p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$2" But what if your hope of one day seeing them in their natural habitat ended - because there weren't any elephants left!  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$3" Two years ago  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 37499477" Newsround went to South Africa  a  to find out more about the ivory trade, and the devastating impact it's had on the world's elephant populations.  p

 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$6" Conservation charity  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 37056625" Tusk told Newsround  a  that if elephant poaching is not stopped, then "there is every chance that elephants will become extinct in a number of African countries within the next decade".  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$7" But how has the situation changed since then?  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$10" It's very difficult to get exact numbers on elephant population figures, and because the last elephant count - called a census - happened in 2016, there is no recent information.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$11" But African elephants are still listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, as they were two years ago.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$12" According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there are now thought to be around 415,000 African elephants left in the wild.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$13" So even though it looks like the numbers have slightly increased, the outlook is still not good, with around 90% of African elephants having been killed in the past century.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$16" Between 2006-2015, around 111,000 African elephants were lost from the wild, mainly due to poaching, and between 2007-2014 30% of Africa's savannah elephants were lost.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$17" The WWF estimate that around 20,000 African elephants are being killed each year for their ivory - that's an average of 55 a day.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$18" African elephants are found in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, but populations in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo have been wiped out over the past 12 years.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__quote-text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$19.$0.0.0.0.1"  span data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$19.$0.0.0.0.1.0" More African elephants are now being poached than being born. No one wants to grow up in a world without elephants and the clock is ticking to save them.   span   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$20" Tusk says in countries like Kenya, elephant numbers have stabilised due to the hard work and efforts of the anti-poaching campaign,   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$21" However, this in turn has led to conflict between humans and elephants, so work is being carried out to try and put elephants off coming near areas where people are living.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$22" On the other hand, in some areas such as the forest elephants in Mali, West Africa, numbers are at a critical level.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$23" Less than a quarter of elephants actually live in protected areas, and only around 30% of the range of African elephants are officially protected.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$26" There are around 40,000-50,000 elephants left in Asia, and like African elephants they are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$27" The number of Asian elephants has declined by at least 50% in the last three generations.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$28" But the reasons why their numbers are falling are a little bit different.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$29" Levels of elephant poaching in Asia are much lower than in Africa, and when poaching does happen, it's mainly as a result of conflict between humans and elephants.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$32" That's because humans often take the land where elephants live in order to farm and develop it, which results in a loss of habitat.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$33" Because of this Asian elephants have disappeared from around 85% of the areas where they used to live, leaving elephant populations spread out over smaller areas.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$34" More than half of the 100 elephants killed each year in India are killed by farmers in a bid to remove the problem of animals raiding their crops.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$35" Another reason why poaching is less common in Asia is because only some male Asian elephants have tusks, and most females don't have any at all.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$37" In contrast all African elephant have tusks, and their tusks are generally bigger, and so contain more ivory.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$38" Wild Asian elephants are found in 13 countries, with around 2,000 Bornean elephants are living in the extreme north-east of Borneo.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$39" Sumatran elephants are critically endangered, with less than 2,800 left in the wild.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$43" The World Wildlife Fund says: "More African elephants are now being poached than being born. No one wants to grow up in a world without elephants and the clock is ticking to save them.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$44" "This World Elephant Day we must recognise the issues that threaten African and Asian elephants and come together to tackle them.   p

 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$49" But on 1 January 2018,  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 39453061" China banned domestic ivory trade  a  - a historic move shutting down the world's biggest legal ivory market.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$50" A number of other countries, including the  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 44222544" UK  a  and  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 21660670" Thailand  a , have also begun taking steps to try and ban the sale of ivory.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$51" The hope is that if poachers can't sell it, they won't kill the elephants for the ivory.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$52" But it seems that more needs to be done to make these steps effective.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$55" The World Wildlife Fund says elephants are facing the most serious conservation crisis since an ivory ban was first imposed in 1989.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$56" In March this year, more than 30 countries across Africa called on the European Union (EU) to close down its ivory market, and support efforts to ban the global ivory trade.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$57" Although the EU banned the export of raw ivory last year, trade is still allowed between member states.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$58" Another issue is that, under current rules antique ivory can still be exported, which dealers are using to try and smuggle newer ivory to Asian markets.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$60" In other countries there have even been signs that laws designed to protect elephants could be relaxed.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$61" Last year US President Donald Trump decided to  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 42015414" allow hunters to bring elephant trophies from certain African countries into the US  a  - something which had been illegal since 2014.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$62" Elephant trophies are things like the tails of elephants, which hunters keep to show off their hunting skills.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$63" But just a day later he changed his mind, saying he'd  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 42036982" keep the trophy ban in place, until he's had more time to "review all conservation facts".  a   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$64.0.0.0.1.$0" It takes place on 12 August.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$64.0.0.0.1.$1" The goal of International Elephant Day is to create awareness of the dangers facing of African and Asian elephants.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$64.0.0.0.1.$2" Organisers also want to share knowledge and ideas to help with better care and management of captive and wild elephants.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$65" Conservations have also been working with local communities and using technology to help fight the ivory trade.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$66" A team from Kings College London have been developing ways to use  span   span  a href="https:  www.bbc.co.uk newsround 35217659" fingerprints left on the ivory to lead them to poachers  a .   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$67" They say that although ivory looks smooth, it has lots of tiny holes that a fingerprint would disappear into, meaning it could be possible to link a person to the illegal trade.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$70" Dogs can also be trained to smell poachers, and sniff out illegal wildlife products, which have been boxed up to be send abroad.   p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$71" The World Wildlife Fund is using GPS technology to tag and track elephants and rhinos, to help rangers monitor and protect the animals.  p 
 p class="newsround-story-body__text" data-reactid=".205m1vlyhby.1.4.2.0.0.0.$72" A special Wildlife Crime Technology Project, using money given by Google, has also led to drones and surveillance and thermal-imaging cameras being set up at waterholes and places poachers might target elephants and rhinos.  p
