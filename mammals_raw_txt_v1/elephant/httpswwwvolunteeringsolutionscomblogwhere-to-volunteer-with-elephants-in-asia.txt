 p Just like in Sri Lanka, elephants are immensely popular in Thailand and are highly revered as well. The love and affection for these giant mammals in Thailand is pretty evident, and that is exactly what the elephant camp volunteering is all about. Gap year travelers who are wildlife enthusiasts and looking for volunteer opportunities for wildlife conservation and welfare can  a href="https:  www.volunteeringsolutions.com thailand elephants-beaches-voluntour" join the Elephant 2 Beaches Program in Chiang Mai  a , which will only give a chance to spend quality time with the animals, but participants will also have the opportunity to go for some adventure at the beaches.  p 
 p Participants will be staying at the elephant camp initially, just would take a travel time of 45 minutes outside main Chiang Mai. The Camp has a beautiful setup, located amidst lush green forests and surrounded by tall mountains from all sides. Every little bit helps in the development of the camp. Late in the afternoon early evening, volunteers will be able to spend more time with the elephants and elephant trainers. This is when volunteers will really begin to bond with these lovely creatures and learn how to take care of them.  p 
 p This program is best suited for wildlife enthusiasts and those who are willing to do some outdoor hard work. After the work wraps up at the camp, volunteers can head out for an adventurous joyride at the beaches, and dive into the turquoise water!  p

 p  span style="font-weight: 400;" What else can one expect from a city which has been coined as the ‚ÄúElephant capital of Thailand‚Äù. Surin is home to over 400 of these wonderful animals. On the outskirts of Surin Province lies the community of Tha-Tum. This community is home to approximately 250 people and over 30 elephants. Through many years of collaboration and volunteering support, it was ensured that the mahouts no longer need to take to the streets and go begging with their elephants. Instead, the community focuses on giving visitors the opportunity to learn about elephants in Thailand, spend time with them and also experience living in the local community.  span   p 
 p  span style="font-weight: 400;" Volunteers spend three nights each week living in the home of the village elder and his family. This is a unique opportunity to see how life operates on a day-to-day basis. During the village stay, three meals each day are included in the program fee that one pays. Volunteers can help in cooking meals and join the folks for their day to day activities in the village.  span   p

During the project, volunteers can take the elephants for a stroll to the nearby river, help in bathing them, learn the tricks from mahouts to communicate and handle the elephants, prepare food for them, and help in keeping their enclosure clean.  span   p
