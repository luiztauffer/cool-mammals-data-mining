The fact that elephant is Laotian national animal also originates from Buddhism, the major religion here. The elephant is Indian Elephant whose hometown is the same as Buddhist hometown. In Buddhist perspective, color elephant represents for luck, peace and wealth, especially, white elephant is the highest representing for power and royalty. br 
Elephant relates to conscious mind. At first, when people were born, they were grey elephant. They don’t know what is right or what is wrong and can’t control their action, just like a wild elephant run freely and destroy everything it encounters. After leading a religious life, it becomes a white elephant which can control its action and is powerful enough to eliminate all of its obstacles.  p

 p Three-head elephant started to appear about eighteenth century since the separation of three smaller countries from Lan Xang in Laos’ history. Those three countries are: Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Champassak. The three heads is the symbol of three major Gods in Buddhist Hindu mythology: BRAHMA, VISHNU AND MAHESH. Among three of them, the creator is Brahma, the keeper is Vishnu and the destroyer is Mahesh. Three-head elephant flag is still Laos’ national Flag until 1975.
